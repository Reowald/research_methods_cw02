Two seven-year-old twin girls have tragically died after the car they were travelling in crashed into a tree about halfway between Perth and Kalgoorlie.

The children died on Sunday morning just after 11am at the crash scene near the Great East Highway in Carrabin, Western Australia.

Their 31-year-old mother, who was behind the wheel, was rushed to Merredin Hospital by St John paramedics before she was released a few hours later.

'Upon arrival at the scene it was confirmed the crash involved a white Toyota Camry sedan, which had left the road and struck a tree,' WA Police said in a statement.

'Tragically, two seven-year-old girls died at the scene.'

The accident shut down the Great Eastern Highway for hours, blocking an important road through the Wheatbelt region.

Police are appealing for anyone with information or dashcam footage to come forward.
