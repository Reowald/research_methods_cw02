Paul Lynch will join our next Guardian Live Book Club to discuss his 2023 Booker prize-winning novel, Prophet Song





Set in an imagined Ireland taken over by a fascist regime, the exhilarating Prophet Song pulls us into the terrifying world of Eilish Stack, a mother of four caught in a collapsing society and trying to hold her family together. As Eilish fights to save her family, the novel asks, how far will she go? And what – or who – is she willing to leave behind?

Lynch’s breathtaking dystopian novel won the 2023 Booker Prize, with the judges praising it for capturing “the social and political anxieties of our age”. It received widespread acclaim for its contemporary resonances, including political extremism and the global plight of refugees fleeing their war-torn homes.

This livestreamed event is part of our online Book Club series, in which the Guardian’s chief books writer, Lisa Allardice, talks to leading writers about their best-known novels and the inspirations behind them. Lynch will also be answering your questions.
