Paris has again been named the world's top city destination, according to a study.

It’s the third year in a row that the French capital has scooped the top spot in Euromonitor International's Top 100 City Destinations ranking.

It is produced by comparing 55 metrics across six ‘key pillars’ – economic and business performance; tourism performance; tourism infrastructure; tourism policy and attractiveness; health and safety, and sustainability.

The report places Dubai second, Madrid third and Tokyo fourth – with the Japanese capital in the top ten for the first time thanks to improved developments in tourism infrastructure. Amsterdam rounds off the top five.

Meanwhile, London, the top-ranking UK city, drops four places to 10th. That’s two places behind New York, which has climbed two places, but far ahead of the next British entry – Edinburgh, which ranks 62nd.

The rest of the top ten comprises Berlin (sixth), Rome (seventh) and Barcelona (ninth).

London is the top-ranking UK city, way ahead of Edinburgh, which ranks 62nd

New York has climbed two places to eighth. It's the top-ranking American city

Dubai comes second based on 55 metrics across ‘key pillars' such as sustainability and attractiveness, and tourism infrastructure

At the very bottom of the ranking is the capital of Oman, Muscat, with Cairo just above in 99th place.

Nadejda Popova, senior manager (Loyalty) at Euromonitor International, said: ‘Paris has retained the title of the world's leading city following exceptional performance across the "pillars".’

Looking at travel and tourism for the years ahead, she said: ‘Rising costs of living, which trigger lower consumer confidence, and fluctuating inflation are expected to be the biggest challenges for the growth of the industry in 2024 and 2025, especially if global recession unveils.

‘Consumers are expected to look for value-for-money travel propositions when booking travel and will continue to favour authentic and local experiences in addition to sustainable tourism alternatives.’

The report reveals that international travel has continued to make a strong recovery in 2023, with a 38 per cent growth in terms of number of trips, projected to reach £1.3billion by the end of the year.

The Spanish capital of Madrid places third in a year when global tourism spending is set to reach $1.7trillion (£1.3trillion)

The Japanese capital, Tokyo, is in the top ten for the first time thanks to improved developments in tourism infrastructure

Egypt's capital Cairo comes a lowly 99th, just above Muscat in Oman, which is at the very bottom of the table

Global tourism spending is set to reach $1.7trillion (£1.3trillion) in 2023.

According to the report, compiled in conjunction with data company Lighthouse, Istanbul is the most popular foreign destination globally, with international arrivals numbering 20.2million – an increase of 26 per cent compared to 2022.

Next comes London, with 18.8million arrivals, followed by Dubai (16.8million).

An important milestone for the recovery of the industry in 2023, the study says, has been the return of Chinese international travel, following the removal of the governmental quarantine.
