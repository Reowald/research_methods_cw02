The UK has voted for its favourite pun-based shop name, and 'Sew It Seams' - a clothing alteration store in Belfast - has nabbed the number one spot.

Language learning platform Babbel scoured TikTok, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook to identify UK shops with clever or amusing names, before putting forward 120 store names to a public vote to find the one that represented the pun-acle of British humour.

In second and third place respectively, overall, came Harlech-based clothing shop Damsel In This Dress and removal company Jean Claude Van Man, from Southport.

Alongside the three national winners, Babbel announced the most popular store names in each UK region - from London-based hair salon Barber Streisand to Dartmoor's Sherlock Holmes-inspired food van The Hound of the Basket Meals (best in the South West) and Shetland's pet-sitting service Hairy Pop-Ins (best in Scotland).

The pun doesn't stop there, though. Best of the East Midlands shop names was Ashbourne's On a Wick and a Prayer - a sparky name for a candle shop.

Rounding out the list was the delightful Frying Nemo, a fish and chip shop in Goole.

Of the contest, NoÃ«l Wolf, cultural expert and Babbel live teacher, said: 'Puns are a cultural phenomenon deeply rooted in British society. Originating from the jesters of mediaeval times and flourishing in the Elizabethan era, the art of punning has evolved through the ages, finding a modern home in everyday conversations.

'These linguistic gems not only highlight the adaptability of the English language but also serve as a reflection of our everyday lives, blending wit with the mundane. From cleverly named shops to literature, this wordplay has become an integral part of our communication landscape.

'As we navigate the twists and turns of modern communication, puns stand as enduring testaments to the charm of language, making the serious business of everyday life a little more entertaining.'
