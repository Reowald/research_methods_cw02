Kudos to Bristol Reclaiming Independent Living (Bril), a grassroots group that has managed to halt one of the ugliest policies towards disabled people that I’ve seen in quite some time.

The city’s Labour-led council had decided that if residential care was a cheaper option than care at home, then disabled people affected would be “offered a place” in a residential care facility. In this context, “offered a place” translates as “forced to take up a place”.

And you thought shutting people up in institutions – out of sight, out of mind – was a grim relic of this country’s history.
