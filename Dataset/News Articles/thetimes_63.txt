It is a startling commentary on the success of the push towards so-called ethical, social and ­governance (ESG) investing that between 2020 and 2022 more than six times as much capital was earmarked for funds which claimed to have high ESG standards than for other equities. Last year, companies listed in the US S&P 500 index ­mentioned ESG an average of nine times a quarter in earnings calls — compared with a maximum of just once in 2017.
