Jannik Sinner followed his grand slam breakthrough at January's Australian Open by claiming the Rotterdam Open title with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Alex de Minaur. The top seed, Sinner, who lost to Daniil Medvedev in last year's Rotterdam final, missed set points against his Australian opponent before wrapping up the first set with a late break.

There was another trade of breaks midway through the second set, but Sinner tamed his opponent's serve once more to lead 4-3 and went on to beat the Australian for a seventh time in as many career meetings, capturing the 12th singles title of his career. It was the Italian's 15th straight win and will lift him to third in the world rankings on Monday.
