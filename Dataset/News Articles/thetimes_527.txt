When Pier Luigi Loro Piana was attending wool auctions in Australia during the Seventies and Eighties, the finest merino fibres clocked in at 16 microns, a nano-measurement used to define the diameter of the most delicate strands to one thousandth of a millimetre (human hair is about 60 or 70).

These days — at the ultra-luxe label his forebears founded in the Twenties — 16 has become standard fare. The micron count of the record-breaking bale sitting in front us, ready to be venerated in an award ceremony at the art dealer Jay Jopling’s Marylebone townhouse, is 10.2.

The highly prized record-breaking merino bale on display

Understandably, then, this pure-as-the-driven white bundle of Mr Whippy-ish folds — somewhere between small hay bale and large yarn ball but mallowy in texture, and wrapped all about with Loro Piana-branded grosgrain ribbon — is every bit as carefully displayed as the pieces from Jopling’s private collection, enthroned and lit like some chunk of classical antiquity in a museum. At roughly 90kg, it contains the fleece of approximately 125 sheep. Given the small run of suits made from 2012’s best bale — 11 microns — cost in the region of $35,000 each, its positioning of guest of honour makes perfect sense.
