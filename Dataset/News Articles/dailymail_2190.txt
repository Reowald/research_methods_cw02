When she slowly made her way down the slipway into the River Lagan in Belfast, RMS Titanic was described as the most luxurious way of crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

Departing Southampton on her maiden voyage to New York City in April 1912 on board were some of the elites of American and British society. Among them was John Jacob Astor, the richest man to travel on Titanic.

Today's super rich would not countenance using a passenger service. Today's superyachts have some of the luxury features seen onboard Titanic, such as a swimming pool, or a sauna.

At 269-metres long, Titanic was far larger than any modern superyacht, though these floating luxury palaces designed only to carry a fraction of the passengers and crew.

At $7.5m, she was one of the most expensive ships of time - a value today of almost $200m. Today's multi billionaires spend far more to carry themselves and their closest friends and relations.

For those who have spent more than $500m on their yacht, they have to budget around 10 per cent of the build price to operate their vessel.

However, some of the yachts with greater numbers of crew could see the 10 per cent figure increase dramatically up to more than £100m a year.

When cruising, the largest super yachts burn at least 500litres of diesel an hour. The average family car's tank is between 50-80 litres.

Of the top ten superyachts, eight have been built since 2002 and are at least 146.3metres in length.

One has been made in the UK, another in the UAE, one is from Denmark and the remainder are from Denmark.
