Spain’s opposition conservative People’s party has retained its absolute majority in Galicia in a close-run regional election.

The PP on Sunday won 40 seats in the 75-seat regional assembly, the electoral board said, with more than 98% of votes counted.

Alfonso Rueda, the victorious Galician regional president, said: “Today, Galicia has voted for common sense. I think that was the correct decision for Galicia and for Spain.”

The Galician Nationalist Bloc finished second with 25 seats, followed by the Socialist party with nine, and Democratic Ourense attained its first seat.

The PP has governed Galicia for all but four of the past 35 years and its leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, is a former regional government leader.

The party has held an absolute majority for the past 15 years and the victory strengthens Feijóo’s position as the country’s main opposition leader against the prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist-led government.
