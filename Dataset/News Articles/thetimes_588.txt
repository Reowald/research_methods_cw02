The Red Bull factory on Thursday purported to launch its new car for the new Formula 1 season, but it was really a showcase of the armour-plating of its central character.

He could have left the performance to his supporting cast, such as the three-times world champion Max Verstappen, for instance, or his new car. Some F1 teams don’t even bother with a live event; they do it online.
