Ireland. Wow. Just wow. How good have they been in this Six Nations so far? Truly outstanding.

And the next question I would ask is not whether anyone can cope with them in this tournament, but whether anyone can cope with them for the next few years. With France experiencing something of a dip and Ireland demonstrating such depth to their squad that they could make a bevy of changes against Italy and still win 36-0, it is looking very ominous for the other five countries.
