Laura, a Scottish-Syrian film-maker, reconnects online with her closest cousin Lujain after 10 years apart. Their paths were separated by war, and now Laura hopes to reconstruct a positive image of the past by sharing memories and family videos with Lujain, who fled to Canada. Lujain has no memories of Syria and, suffering from the trauma of war, has forgotten many of their times together. As they reconnect, they begin to rebuild their friendship and reflect on how war continues to affect every relationship long after it ends
