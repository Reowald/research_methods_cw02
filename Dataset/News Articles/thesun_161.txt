KYLIAN MBAPPE has signed a five-year contract with Real Madrid, according to reports in Spain.

The 25-year-old will leave Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer when his contract expires at the end of the season.

Arsenal and Liverpool have both been linked with a summer swoop for him, but Marca claim Real Madrid won the transfer race two weeks ago.

Mbappe allegedly put pen to paper on a contract earlier this month, making a "firm commitment" to Los Blancos.

The Frenchman has signed a five-year deal, keeping him at the Santiago Bernabeu until June 2029.

Real Madrid are set to hand him a £85.5million signing-on fee upon his arrival.

Mbappe will become the club's highest earner, surpassing Jude Bellingham.

That's despite taking a pay-cut and accepting a lower wage.

He reportedly demanded a minimum of £42.8m-a-season - around £827,000-a-week - during negotiations.

However, Real Madrid officials wanted to bring that figure down.

2 Mbappe has been in amazing form for PSG this season

Los Blancos have been pushing to sign the forward since his Monaco days.

Mbappe came close to making the move in 2022, but announced a two-year extension with PSG instead.

He caused a stir among the PSG camp last summer after refusing to sign a new contract.

The Ligue 1 giants subsequently accepted a huge £259million offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal for him, but Mbappe rejected the move.

He was briefly axed from the squad and sent to train with PSG's "undesirables" - a group of players not wanted by the club.

However, he made a return at the start of the Ligue 1 campaign and has since scored 32 goals in 31 appearances across all competitions.
