If you own one of these 10 cars then don't expect to make a quick sale when it's time to replace it. That's because they all take between two and two-and-a-half months to shift on average, according to data from the nation's largest car sales platform. In contrast, the most in-demand motor takes an average of just two weeks to find a buyer. Topping the list of difficult-to-sell cars is a small Vauxhall SUV. However, four of the top 10 listed for the longest periods are Land Rovers - including three Range Rover models - as reports of the luxury SUVs being targeted by gangs of organised thieves and owners finding it difficult to secure affordable insurance is putting second-hand buyers off the notion of owning one.
