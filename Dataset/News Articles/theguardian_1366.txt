128 entries, no noticeable mistakes. Favourite clue of the month (of 15 mentioned): ‘Seed’s early stage in rubber, trailing 0-5’ for OVULE. The clue word this time was a definite oddity, and a tough one to clue originally. As you clearly discovered, it proved very difficult to devise wording that convincingly linked the definition part with the cryptic element. The word itself doesn’t even appear in the OED (not in my edition anyway) and only creeps into the SOED (1993), labelled L19, i.e. late nineteenth-century, and defined as ‘a pathological desire to count objects or make calculations’. I doubt if it is much used these days as a technical term, if at all. I chose it as a curiosity, but should perhaps have thought more about its suitability. No one complained too much. Azed competitors are always up for a challenge.

You will have noticed that the Rules and requests have been modified and extended, an attempt by the people at the Guardian/Observer to make them more helpful for competitors. I’m not too happy with the result, and have said so, so you may expect further changes. In particular I did not give my approval to the general acceptability of emailed entries from home as well as abroad. Although this was welcomed by some, it would, if retained, involve me in quite a lot of extra work, so I’m afraid we shall be reverting to limiting such entries to those from outside the UK.

I receive occasional queries about the future of the andlit.org website, the brilliant brainchild of John Tozer. As many of you will by now have heard, John suffered a severe illness over a year ago and will be unable to apply himself to maintaining the site, at least for the foreseeable future. I’m sure we all wish him and his family the very best during this protracted period of recovery.
