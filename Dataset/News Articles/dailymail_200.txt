Gary Neville and Roy Keane have alleged that some of the teams Manchester United faced in Europe under Sir Alex Ferguson were guilty of doping.

The former Old Trafford stars said that Italian teams, in particular, had aroused the suspicions of the United players, with Neville claiming they ‘weren’t clean’.

United came up against Inter Milan, AC Milan, Juventus, Fiorentina, Roma and Lazio in Europe during the Ferguson era.

Speaking on the Stick To Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, with Keane, Jamie Carragher and Ian Wright, Neville drew comparisons between football and other sports with doping issues like cycling.

‘There are a couple that stick in my mind,’ he said. ‘I think there were a few teams that we played against that weren’t clean.

‘I came off the pitch against an Italian team and thought, “that’s not right”. I’m sorry. I know that a couple of the other lads mid-2000s thought exactly the same thing.’

Keane agreed with his former team-mate as he recalled facing the Italians in Europe.

‘When we played certain teams I would be walking off and you were absolutely shattered,’ said Keane.

‘I remember it. I would be looking at the players I played against, a couple of the Italian teams, and they looked like they’d not even played a match.

‘Why can’t we talk about that? We’re not naming names or clubs.’
