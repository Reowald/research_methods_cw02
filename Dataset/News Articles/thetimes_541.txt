By all means opt for a heart-shaped jewellery gift this Valentine’s, but you won’t gain any brownie points for originality. Instead, think outside the box with these more esoteric declarations.

Love you to the moon and back

It’s every millennial’s favourite declaration. If it’s yours too, a moon jewel is the perfect expression. Eugenie Niarchos at Venyx does a beautiful lunar offering and her by-appointment showroom off South Molton Street in London could be the ideal date destination. For other options look to Anna Maccieri Rossi or Lucy Delius at Net-A-Porter.

Cupid’s arrow

The arrow has long been a popular motif in jewellery. The Victorians were particularly fond of it and it’s still possible to find antique arrow brooches if you browse the right dealers such as Grays Antique Market or Bentley & Skinner in Piccadilly, which has a beautiful Cartier diamond version. Annoushka’s new Flight collection is a mash-up of deco inspiration that incorporates arrows and New York architecture — the diamond-set earrings will definitely impress.
