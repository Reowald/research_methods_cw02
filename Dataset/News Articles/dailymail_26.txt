Welcome back to the Soul of Sport. For the latest episode of the series, ANDY HOOPER travelled to Kenilworth Road to watch Man United beat Luton 2-1.

With Aston Villa and Tottenham surging ahead in the fight for Champions League football, the pressure was on Erik ten Hag's side to secure all three points.

And they enjoyed a scintillating start to the game, with Rasmus Hojlund scoring twice inside the first 10 minutes to place United firmly in cruise control.

However, Luton then hit back through Carlton Morris, who reached a cross before Andre Onana and headed home.

Both sides squandered golden chances after half-time, with United missing several one-on-one opportunities and Ross Barkley nodding against the crossbar for the hosts in injury time, leaving the Red Devils narrow victors.

The result propelled them just five points behind fourth place and three points adrift of Spurs.
