Porthtowan, Cornwall

Porthtowan beach is flanked by sheer cliffs and caves - with a vast expanse of sand at low tide for cricket and rounders – making it a firm favourite with families. Surfers flock here, too. Hidden behind the craggy rock formation is a tidal pool perfect for swimmers. If you are an onlooker, rather than a participant, there is a three-bedroom penthouse for sale with an L-shaped terrace and a hot tub overlooking the beach. It has a Juliet balcony off the master bedroom, and there is a path outside that winds down to the bay. £975,000. Lillicrap Chilcott , 01872 273 473
