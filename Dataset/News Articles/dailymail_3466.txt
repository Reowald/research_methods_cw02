The Victorian police force has been rocked by its second suicide within weeks after an officer took his own life while on duty at a Melbourne station.

The male officer was found dead at Glen Waverley police station, in the city's south-east, just after 12.30pm on Friday.

The tragedy comes after officer Rowan Andrews, 38, was found dead at Laverton Railway Station, in the city's inner-west, during the early hours of January 12. He was not on duty at the time.

Victoria Police said the exact circumstances surrounding the latest death are being investigated.

But the death is not being treated as suspicious and a report will be prepared for the coroner.

Meanwhile, devastated friends have flocked online to pay tribute to the young male officer.

In one touching post, a man urged others to be kinder to emergency services personnel as they have tough jobs protecting the community.

'Rest in peace young man,' he began.

'Police officers are human too but the sadness hits them a lot harder than [the] normal public as they deal with a lot of negativity in their usual work day.

'Just because they wear a uniform, doesn't mean they are bullet proof. If you're married to them or are in a relationship with them, then it becomes your responsibility that you understand and keep an eye on what they're going through.

'A gentle tap on the shoulder at the right time can make a difference between life and death.

'If you're going through something then please make sure that you talk, talk to someone.'
