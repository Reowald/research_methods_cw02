Rorie reportedly completed an Irwin-approved 'wildlife warrior boot camp' before she and Robert became an official couple.

In December, Woman's Day claimed that Rorie had to win over the family by having a willingness to get out into nature.

The couple went on crocodile research trip together where they uncovered 'critical data' for the Wildlife Warriors' Worldwide foundation.

Mother Terri and sister Bindi, 25, had been impressed by Rorie's dedication to Australian wildlife.

An insider claimed Rorie was 'determined to not let Robert down and show him - and his mum and sister - that she's not just some puff piece. And she blew them away.'

The pair were in a long-distance relationship, with Robert based at Australia Zoo in Queensland while Rorie lives in Perth.

Robert and Rorie, who is the niece of legendary Australian actor Heath Ledger, have plenty in common and both grew up in the public eye after suffering the devastating loss of a family member.

Heath was at the top of his Hollywood career when he was found dead in January 2008 following an accidental prescription drug overdose.

Robert's father Steve Irwin, known to the world as the 'Crocodile Hunter', died aged 44 on September 4, 2006, after being pierced in the chest by a stingray.

In November, Robert opened up about his 'amazing' girlfriend on Nova's Fitzy and Wippa with Kate Ritchie.

The Wildlife Warrior expressed his joy regarding his relationship after host Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli brought up the topic.

'I feel like life is amazing right now and [I'm] very, very happy,' said Robert.

Following the discussion about his sister Bindi, Wippa called the relationship 'great news' then asked how serious the young zookeeper was about Buckey on a scale of 1 to 10: 'is it a 10?'

Robert then gave a heartwarming answer: 'Love is not a numbers game. You just feel it.'

It was rumoured Robert was preparing to pop the question to his girlfriend.

According to New Idea magazine, he could have proposed when his girlfriend visited him in Africa while he films I'm A Celebrity.

'Everyone is convinced he is aiming to pop the question when they're in Africa,' an insider said.

'Robert is crazy about her and is planning something unforgettable when he formally proposes. They both know it is part of their plans so he's been dreaming up special ways to make it a surprise.'

The source went on to say Robert and Rorie were taking their relationship 'very serious' and had been planning a future together.

'They have talked about where to live and even how big they want their family to be,' they added.
