Leaving Boppard, as the sun crests the surrounding hilltops, expectation rises at what lies in store as we journey through the outstanding natural beauty of the Rhine Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here, at every dramatic turn of the river, towering valley slopes are crowned by the precarious ruins of castles built by princes to display their power and extort tolls from passing river traffic. The Gorge is home to medieval legends, tales of mysterious happenings and dark deeds, most famously the Lorelei – or ‘murmuring rock’ – said to have lured passing boats onto the rocks with its irresistible song. The villages drifting by – Saint Goar, Bacharach and Kaub – are synonymous with wine production and one of the many thoughtful details of this cruise is the carefully compiled wine list, from which you can choose fine Rhine and Moselle wines to enjoy with the foods sourced from the region. During lunch, we arrive in Rüdesheim, for a guided tour with our local expert. Perhaps the best known of all the wine towns, the picturesque crooked houses slope down from wooded hillsides and terraced vineyards. Meander through the Market Place, Brömserburg Castle and the charming Klunkhardshof, a monumental half-timbered building dating back to the first half of the 16th-century. You’ll also see the Brömserhof, now the home of Siegfried‘s excellent mechanical music museum - a collection of around 350 intricate antique musical instruments and musical boxes from all over the world, many in working order, still playing the delicate sounds of yesteryear. This evening the Captain’s Dinner takes place on board, during which delicious specialities of the regions you’ve visited will be served, hosted by the Captain himself, of course.
