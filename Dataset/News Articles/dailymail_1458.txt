It may have been one of the mildest Novembers on record - but now prepare for snow



By November 24 last year most of the country was already frozen over, with widespread severe frosts, deep snowfall and travel chaos.



The deepest falls were covering East Scotland, the North East, East Anglia and the South East, with huge drifts affecting hilly parts of the North. Altnaharra, in the far North of Scotland, felt -21C.



More snow fell through to the start of the Christmas break, bringing severe frosts, but milder weather and rain arrived before New Year.

This November was totally different, being the second mildest on record. It ended very wet and windy, especially in the North West, where flooding and wild weather was most severe.



Last Tuesday a squall line lifted wind gusts to 74mph at Capel Curig, Snowdonia, with heavy, driving rain spreading east through the afternoon.

Central Scotland was worst hit.

Glasgow Bishopton recorded 2.6ins (66mm) of rain in 24 hours and Greenock suffered rising floods.
