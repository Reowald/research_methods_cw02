Henderson reaction

John Henderson admitted it was “massive” to take the World Seniors title.

The Huntly hurler beat Colin McGarry 5-0 in the final at the Circus Tavern in Essex last night (Sunday).

It kept the title in Scotland after Robert Thornton had won the previous two championships.

Hendo, 50, won the title at his first attempt with a wonderful 114 finish and completed an incredible turnaround in his life after losing FOUR STONE since the pandemic and almost reversing Diabetes.

He said: “I was lucky, some games I rode my luck. Winning the World Cup with Peter Wright was great but this is right up there.

“It’s good to keep the trophy north of the border after two years with Robert. That’s special.

“It’s absolutely fantastic to win and the crowd have been amazing. It’s massive for me.”

Hendo has changed his lifestyle completely since the pandemic and is delighted with his new found stamina.

He added: “I’m close to reversing my Diabetes. My blood sugars are at a good level now but for the next 12 months they want to keep me on the medication.

“I’ve just got to continue my exercise and diet. The weight is now coming off slower.

“But in total I’ve lost four stone since the pandemic. I was so bored so I was walking my partner Veronica to the bus and back every day.

“I’m now eating a lot healthier, I just stick to salads and have cut out the greasy food.

“I have got a lot more stamina and more energy during the long days.”
