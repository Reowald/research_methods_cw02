A 12-week consultation will aim to improve the preservation of the country’s artefacts

The rules around how archaeological finds are handled in Scotland are being rewritten after a surge in metal detecting across the country.

It is the first time in 20 years that a consultation on the process for assessing and preserving ancient artefacts has been held by the Crown Office, which is responsible for the Treasure Trove Unit (TTU).

John Logue, the King’s and Lord Treasurer’s Remembrancer (KLTR), opened the consultation and said: “The role of treasure trove is to ensure that objects of cultural significance from Scotland’s past are protected for public benefit and preserved in museums across the country.

“We want to ensure that artefacts found in Scotland continue to provide maximum benefit to the public in understanding the significance of Scotland’s archaeological heritage.”
