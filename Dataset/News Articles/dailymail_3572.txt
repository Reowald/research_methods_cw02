Married At First Sight bride Natalie Parham abruptly quit the Channel Nine dating show last week after failing to find a connection with husband Collins Christian.

But it appears as if the 32-year-old TV bride is anything but heartbroken as she attended her first event as an influencer.

Natalie was all smiles at the launch party of Benny's American Burgers in the heart of South Yarra, Melbourne.

Natalie looked stylish in a red dress as she posed alongside former MAFS groom Liam Cooper, who appeared on the dating show in 2021.

Also attending the event was Liam's ex-boyfriend Samuel Levi.
