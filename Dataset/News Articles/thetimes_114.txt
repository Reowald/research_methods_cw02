BET OF THE DAY

Tribal Wisdom (2.17 Lingfield Park)

This former Godolphin inmate has returned to form with a vengeance of late for trainer Ian Williams and he can complete a treble here.

He scored impressively over this course and distance last month, showing a fine turn of foot, and again quickened in good style when repeating the dose at Wolverhampton last time.

Tribal Wisdom has been raised 12lb for those two wins but is still 15lb lower than his initial handicap mark and his change of gear can again prove decisive.
