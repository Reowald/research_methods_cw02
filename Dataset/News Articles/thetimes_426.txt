Scotland was the first country to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol

£4 added to a bottle amid industry warnings that rise will cost jobs and government admits minimum pricing is ‘not a silver bullet’ to tackle problem drinking

The minimum price for a bottle of whisky will rise by 30 per cent, to more than £18, and unions fear that the changes will endanger jobs and investment in the drinks sector.

Shona Robison, the deputy first minister, told MSPs that there would be an increase in the minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol, from 50p to 65p.

In 2018 Scotland became the first country in the world to introduce such a policy, but there have been concerns about whether it is effective in tackling problem drinking. Robison said she was aware that MUP was “not a silver bullet” but said it was part of a range of tools required to tackle alcohol-related harm.

Opponents pointed to a 14-year high of 1,276 alcohol-related deaths
