Britain’s Phil Sesemann took a major step towards qualification for the Paris Olympics with his time at the Sevilla Marathon on Sunday.

Sesemann ran an official time of 2 hours, eight minutes and four seconds, narrowly breaking the Paris standard by just six seconds. The 31-year-old set his personal best in the marathon, taking 45 seconds off his previous best set in Valencia in December.

He is now likely to be one of Britain’s representatives in Paris this summer, with each nation permitted to submit up to three marathon runners per men’s and women’s race.

Ethiopia’s Deresa Geleta won the men’s race with a course record time of 2:03:25, while compatriot Azmera Gebru won the women’s race.

Here are the top results from Sunday’s race in both the men’s and women’s events:
