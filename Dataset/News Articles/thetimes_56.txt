The metaphor of the landslide invites a picture of the ground giving way to a rockfall. A natural landslide is a spectacular event, as erosion defeats the land mass and the hydrostatic pressure opens the cracks and fissures in the stable ground beneath. In its transfer to politics, the landslide implies vigour and heat and excitement.

To say that a party can expect a landslide is to say that the country has fallen rapidly and overwhelmingly in its favour. Political landslides seem to be born of love. After handsome Labour victories in the Kingswood and Wellingborough by-elections on Thursday, we can see that the metaphor is misleading. It is time to prepare for the lukewarm landslide.
