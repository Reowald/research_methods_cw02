The home I was brought up in [in Katonah, New York] had a real impact on me. It was really simple, not a big house at all, at the end of a cul-de-sac on the top of a hill and built in the 1960s. We moved there when I was about three. My dad did a huge amount of work to it and in it, building cabinets and things like that. It was just a great place to grow up.

We had three bedrooms. Eventually my bedroom became a dining room and I was moved downstairs to the basement, which made me very happy as a young teenager. There were woods and we had beautiful snow every winter, and gorgeous colours every autumn.
