Day

Day 3

After breakfast, depart by coach to pick up the Beatles trail back in and around Liverpool. Drift back through time as you visit the Strawberry Field Visitor Centre – its name etched in the consciousness of The Beatles fans forever. Stop for a drink or a bite to eat (payable locally), before the tour continues past the childhood homes of John, Paul and Ringo, and their schools and colleges. You’ll pass the birthplaces of John Lennon and Brian Epstein – The Beatles’ legendary manager – before paying a visit to Liverpool Cathedral, the world’s fifth-largest and where Paul McCartney once auditioned for the local choir. This evening is at your leisure, providing the perfect opportunity to visit a reconstruction of the legendary Cavern Club (payable locally) for some live music, which is just a short walk away. The Cavern Club is where Brian Epstein first saw the Beatles perform live. Epstein signed them, and the rest, as they say, is history!
