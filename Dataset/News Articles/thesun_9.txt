“A ceasefire that lasts.

"That is what must happen now.

"The fighting must stop now.”

This week there will be a SNP-led vote in the Commons on an immediate cessation of fighting.

Labour has yet to rule out backing the vote amid fears it could reopen divides among MPs.

The Labour leader, fresh from an appearance at a gathering of top politicians in Germany, said every conversation there had focused on the crisis in the Middle East.

He said: “I have just returned from the Munich Security Conference where every conversation I had came back to the situation in Israel and Gaza and the question of what we can do practically to deliver what we all want to see...

"...a return of all the hostages taken on October 7th, an end to the killing of innocent Palestinians, a huge scaling up of humanitarian relief and an end to the fighting."
