Mikel Arteta praised Arsenal's 'elite mentality' after his side fired the title race wide open with a stirring win over leaders Liverpool.

Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard struck to propel the Gunners to within two points of Jurgen Klopp's team as they clinched a euphoric win at the Emirates.

'They put their heart and soul into every single ball,' said Arteta.

'It's three wins in a row now in a really convincing way, we have to go for it. The whole season is now ahead of us.

'We have shown today that today we have an elite mentality. Absolutely.

'But now we have to do it tomorrow in training and when we play against West Ham.

'We are there in the title race and we want to continue to be there - it's up to us to make it happen.'

Arteta's injury concerns are mounting, however.

Oleksandr Zinchenko was substituted at half-time after complaining of a calf problem, while Gabriel Jesus missed the game with a knee injury.

'With Gabi we are expecting it's just a matter of days but with Olek we don't know because he had some feeling in his calf again,' said Arteta.

Bukayo Saka limped off towards the end but Arteta added: 'He should be fine, he took a kick on the the back of the ankle.'
