Earlier this month she revealed her hair has been growing back since undergoing chemotherapy.

But this morning shared a snap from a hospital bed.

Amy said: "So last week didn't exactly go to plan! Feeling much better now and still taking it easy.

"But can't thank the NHS and the care I received on the respiratory unit enough!"

She added: "Also to my family and Ben of course. Always dropping everything and spending endless hours next to my bed while I mainly slept."

Sharing another snap with an oxygen mask on, she said: "Feeling much better and thanks for the many messages after going quiet!

"Off to oncology unit today for my monthly injection (missed it last week with being poorly)."

It comes after Amy admitted she was so terrified of being axed from the BBC dance show.

Her close pal Sara Davies revealed that she almost delayed her chemotherapy.

Speaking on the Invite Only show, Sara said: "I spent a lot of time with her at the start of the cancer diagnosis when she wasn't feeling positive. She'd been dealt a bad hand and she was struggling with it."

She continued: "I was the one who was like, 'What's the plan, Amy?' and pushing her to make difficult decisions.

"She wasn't sure if she was going to have chemo so we talked about that."
