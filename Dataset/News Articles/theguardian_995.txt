Healey, North Yorkshire

In this small village on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales and in the Nidderdale area of outstanding natural beauty, is Pinewood Manor, a grand Edwardian country house. Built in 1905 by the water board for its surveyors working on the reservoirs, the now eight-bedroom property was requisitioned in the first and second world wars by the West Yorkshire Regiment. The mock Tudor house has an indoor pool, a stable block and a two-bedroom converted cottage within 3.2 hectares (eight acres) and adjoining the 8,093-hectare (20,000-acre) Swinton Castle estate.
