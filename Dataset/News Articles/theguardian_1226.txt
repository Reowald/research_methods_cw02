Taylor Swift has donated $100,000 (£79,000) to the family of Lisa Lopez-Galvan, who was killed in a mass shooting at a parade for Super Bowl-winning football team Kansas City Chiefs.

The singer, whose boyfriend Travis Kelce plays for the team, made two $50,000 donations and wrote: “Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss.” A representative for Swift confirmed to Variety that the donations were genuine.

The fund was set up to provide “vital financial support” to the family of radio DJ Lopez-Galvan, “as they process this unthinkable tragedy”. She is survived by her husband and two children.

Twenty-one others were injured in the attack, more than half of them under the age of 16 and many of them with life-threatening injuries. Staff at the city’s university hospital, one of three receiving patients, said on Thursday that of the eight they received, three were discharged, one was in a stable condition, and two were in a critical condition but improving.

Kansas City police chief Stacey Graves said the shooting had “no nexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism”, was not targeting the parade itself, and “appeared to be a dispute between several people that ended in gunfire”. Three people were arrested, and two teenage children remain in custody.

Kansas City Chiefs said in a statement that they were “truly saddened by the senseless act of violence”, while Kelce said he was “heartbroken over the tragedy”.

Swift has made numerous financial donations over the years, including $1m for tornado relief efforts in her native Nashville in 2020.

She is currently performing in Australia on her record-breaking Eras tour. In August she gave around $5m in bonuses to the team of truck drivers working on the tour.
