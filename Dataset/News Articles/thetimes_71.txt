Profits at the price comparison website have risen sharply as car and home owners seek relief from the soaring cost of insurance

Moneysupermarket.com has reported a sharp rise in profits, with the price comparison website boosted by its insurance operation as customers sought relief from exceptionally high premium inflation.

In the year to the end of December, pre-tax profits rose 8 per cent to £92.1 million, up from £85.2 million previously, on the back of revenue rising 11 per cent to £432.1 million.

The growth was led by what the company called “exceptional trading” in insurance. Revenue in the sector leapt 27 per cent in the final quarter as sky-high insurance premium inflation drove search traffic and led to high levels of switching for car and home insurance. Moneysupermarket said the trend continued in the first few weeks of this year.
