A MAJOR car firm has unveiled a new electric SUV set to become the "UK's most affordable EV".

Dubbed the Seres 3, the latest motor set to be available on the market for Brits is headed over from China.

Hoping to make an appearance in spring, it will have a starting price of £29,995 - making it £500 cheaper than what is currently on sale.

The MG ZS EV will soon be replaced as the cheapest electric vehicle around once the Seres 3 hits the roads.

Despite such a difference in price, the Seres 3 does offer a similar range to the MG ZS EV.

It can drive up to 205 miles on one charge - which can then extend to 315 if conditions remain the same.

The SUV can also reach an 80 per cent charge in just 30 minutes.

Quick off the mark, it can go from zero to 62mph in just 8.9 seconds.

When it comes to the size, the motor is just over four metres long, nearly two metres wide and around 1.6m tall.

This makes it a similar build to a Nissan Qashqai.

Buyers will have a choice of two trim levels: Active and Spirit.

Models feature touchscreen, reversing camera, keyless start, rear parking sensors, 18-inch alloy wheels and leather seats.

But if you fancy upgrading for the the slightly higher cost of £31,995, you could enjoy more add-ons.

The more expensive model includes a panoramic sunroof, wireless smartphone charging pad, cruise control, lane departure warning, front parking sensors, heated front seats and power folding side mirrors.

UK firm Innovation Automotive will be handling sales of the Seres 3.
