Conservative MPs are open to attacks over the party’s record on water pollution with nearly 39,000 sewage spills in marginal constituencies in 2022

Battleground seats held by the Conservatives have the highest number of sewage spills of any marginal constituencies, The Times has found.

The figures show how exposed Tory MPs are to attacks over the party’s record on water pollution. Seats won in the 2019 general election by a margin of less than 10 per cent will be crucial when people next vote.

The Times can reveal that of the 79,467 sewage spills in marginal constituencies in 2022, over 39,000 were in Conservative seats, more than those held by any other party. Labour marginal seats were second at little more than 26,000.

The Liberal Democrats have made sewage one of their top campaign issues, with Sir Ed Davey, the party leader, saying Tory voters were “very, very angry” over spills.
