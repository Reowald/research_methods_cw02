Famous YouTuber Kai Cenat showed up to NBA All-Star weekend's celebrity game with Warriors guard Steph Curry on Friday night in Indianapolis.

Curry showed up in grey sweats, while Cenat had a cigar in his mouth while wearing all black.

Once the two men were walking side by side, one clear difference appeared to fans online.

Cenat competed in the celebrity basketball game despite being 5-foot-3. Curry, who looks smaller than most of his NBA contemporaries, stands 6-foot-2 and towers over Cenat.

Cenat was on the winning team and was close to tears during the trophy presentation despite seeing limited minutes and only scoring four points. And the internet had a field day with his appearance.

'Kai is the only basketball player that can make Steph look tall,' one fan said on social media.

'He looks like one of those kids that dresses up as an adult to get on a rollercoaster,' another basketball fan said of Cenat.

'Steph be looking like his bodyguard,' one person stated on X.

Cenat was largely ignored by his teammates during the game, including one occasion by the game's MVP, Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons.

Parsons opted for an air ball over passing the it to Cenat, who was jumping up and down looking for the pass.
