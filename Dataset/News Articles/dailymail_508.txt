The Game of Thrones actress, 45, looked incredible in the jacket which she teamed with opaque white tights and matching pointed toe heels.

Gwendonline completed her evening outfit with a swipe of bold red lipstick as she beamed while posing for selfies with guests.

It comes after the star turned heads in a baby pink Fendi gown at the star-studded 2023 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City.

The Wednesday actress showcased her long 6ft 3in frame in the incredible pale ensemble.

The unique look hugged her figure by the waist, before flowing out into a small train and wispy sleeves.

The Game Of Thrones alum added matching heels for the monochrome look as she was almost smothered by her gorgeous outfit.

Gwendoline's signature platinum tresses were then styled in a chic side-parting as her locks fell over her right shoulder.

But her special frock was the centre of attention of her look, as it gathered by her back before pooling at her feet.

The ensemble scarcely revealed any of her porcelain skin, apart from a subtle glimpse at her shoulders and upper back.

Gwendoline shot to fame in HBO fantasy-drama series Game of Thrones as she portrayed Brienne of Tarth.

She has also starred in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
