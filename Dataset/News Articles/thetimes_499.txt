James, the son of Ian Coates, speaks outside Nottingham crown court. Beside him are Dr Sanjoy Kumar and Emma Webber, who lost their children in the attacks

James Coates believes Valdo Calocane got away with murdering his father, Ian. But he thinks the expertise of the bereaved can force a public inquiry

Ian Coates was five months away from retirement, looking forward to spending it with his two greatest loves: his grandchildren and his fishing club.

“His grandchildren meant everything to him,” said his son, James. The family knew the 65-year-old school caretaker would not be slowing down: he would be helping his children with DIY around the house or organising fishing trips for young people in the community. “He was always very selfless,” said James.

On the morning of June 13, just after 5am, Coates was driving his van through Nottingham to begin work when he was ambushed by Valdo Calocane. Calocane, a paranoid schizophrenic, had just fatally stabbed two students, Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber, both 19, who were walking home from a night out.
