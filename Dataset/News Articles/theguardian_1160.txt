This indulgent, light, airy and floral version of the famous Ramos gin fizz is one of those drinks that disappears before you realise it’s gone.

Meringue gin fizz

40ml good-quality dry gin

60ml Mozart white chocolate liqueur

15ml Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto

25ml fresh lemon juice

1 egg white

Soda water, to top

1 lemon twist, to finish

Put a highball glass in the freezer. Measure all the ingredients except the soda and lemon twist into a cocktail shaker, dry-shake for 10-15 seconds, to set the egg white, then add a handful of ice and shake again for 15 seconds. Double-strain into an empty mixing tin or jug (if you have a milk frother, aerate the mix even more by frothing it for a minute).

Take the glass out of the freezer and pour in two fingers’ worth of soda water (or roughly 50ml). From a height, slowly pour in some of the cocktail mix – this will introduce even more air to it– then let the meringue settle before repeating with more of the cocktail mix, until the head pops up just above the lip of the glass without spilling over it.

Top gently with more soda water, so the foam rises elegantly, then squeeze the lemon peel over the top, to express the oils; discard the peel. Serve with a straw.
