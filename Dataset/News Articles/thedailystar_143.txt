“But now I’m like, ‘What’s the worst that can happen?’. If it’s not for me then I can say, ‘At least I tried’. I want to go for things now. I’m excited to see what will happen.”

Margot Robbie left Neighbours and became the highest-paid actress in Hollywood. Others who have made it big include Hollyoaks star Nathalie Emmanuel and EastEnders hunk Ben Hardy.

She said: “They’re inspiring. They’ve started off on soaps and then moved on to other things. It’s nice to look up to people who have come from the same background.

Ellie is set to tour the country in play Cluedo 2, which kicks off at the Richmond Theatre on February 29.
