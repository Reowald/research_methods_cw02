Andrew Saunders is an analyst at Shore Capital, not Peel Hunt as we wrongly said (“Picking out some hot properties”, Business, Feb 15).

February 15, 2024

We reported that an article in a withdrawn issue of the Royal Society of Literature’s magazine referred to “the Israeli war machine” (“War of wisely chosen words at literature’s royal society”, News, Feb 3). While the article in question referred to “the devastating machinery of the Israeli state in operation: the armed checkpoints, apartheid road systems, arbitrary identity checks against Palestinian children and other violent structural harms”, the RSL has asked us to make clear that the phrase “Israeli war machine” was not used.

February 14, 2024

The walls of the small modular reactor pressure vessel built by Sheffield Forgemasters are 20 centimetres thick, not 2 centimetres as we wrongly said (Business, Feb 12).

February 11, 2024

We wrongly described Celia Kitzinger as a professor of psychology at the University of York and a campaigner for assisted dying (Catholic neurologist cleared of letting faith prejudice court evidence, News, Feb 8). She is a retired professor of sociology and campaigns to promote advance decisions on refusing treatment.

February 7, 2024

An opinion column stated that a government-commissioned report into the Teesworks development “contradicted several linchpin claims made in Private Eye” about the project, including on the sale of land and dividends received by business partners (Juliet Samuel, “Rare Tory success offers model for the future”, Comment, Jan 31). This was incorrect. While the report provided context on deals related to the land sale and use of dividends that in our opinion justifies a more positive view than was taken by Private Eye, we accept that it did not contradict claims made by the magazine.

February 3, 2024

We wrongly say in the Magazine today (“Why everyone wants what he’s having”) that St John, Smithfield, is run by Fergus and Margot Henderson and Trevor Gulliver. Margot Henderson has no affiliation with the restaurant.

January 22, 2024

While Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King’s College London, has taught students on a King’s counter-terrorism course, he is not the “course director” as we wrongly said (News, Jan 17, 18). We are happy to make this clear.

January 4, 2024

We referred to claims made against the late Greville Janner “and other unconvicted sex offenders” (comment, Dec 29). While Lord Janner of Braunstone was charged with 22 offences relating to nine complainants, he died before the offences could be tried. We are happy to make this clear.

January 3, 2024

A book review referring to Mary Wollstonecraft was wrongly illustrated with a portrait of her daughter, Mary Shelley (Saturday Review, Dec 30).

December 31, 2023

An article about Rolls-Royce, the aerospace engineer, was wrongly illustrated with a photograph of a Rolls-Royce car. The motor manufacturer is a separate unrelated company.

December 22, 2023

In an article about a sponsorship deal with the Science Museum (Dec 5) we stated that its chief executive would no longer be involved in decisions over the ethics of sponsorship deals. We have been asked by the Science Museum’s chair to clarify that, while the CEO is not part of a new advisory group that reviews the ethics of those deals, he remains involved in decisions taken by the board of trustees. We are happy to do so.

December 18, 2023

The World Vapers’ Alliance did not hand out free e-cigarettes from its “vape bus”, as we wrongly said (news, Dec 14 & 15). It gave out free branded merchandise such as hats and mugs.

December 8, 2023

We wrongly said that the County Councils Network (CNN) had claimed middle-class parents are to blame for councils’ budget crises (Comment, Dec 7). While individual council sources may have made such claims, we have been asked to make clear that this is not the position of the CNN.

December 7, 2023

We said that benefit fraudsters make up 2 per cent of the UK’s annual fraud and tax fraudsters 69 per cent (Magazine, Dec 2). The latest figures put benefit fraud at £6.4bn and the “tax gap” (the amount of tax going unpaid) at £35.8bn. The latter figure includes tax lost to error, legal avoidance and all kinds of non-compliance, as well as fraud. We are happy to make this clear.

December 4, 2023

Reporting the acquittal of Chris McEleny on charges of causing a disturbance (Scotland, Dec 1), we referred in a headline to a claim heard in court that some of Mr McEleny’s evidence was “unreliable and not credible”. As the accompanying article explained, the claim about Mr McEleny’s evidence was made by the fiscal depute prosecuting the case. We are happy to make this clear.

December 1, 2023

A letter published on Nov 28 said 63 per cent of London’s population were born overseas. In fact 41 per cent were born overseas and 63 per cent are from ethnic minorities.

November 27, 2023

We reported a suggestion from a botanist in South Africa (news, November 23) that the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, should repatriate some specimens from its herbarium instead of moving them to Reading. Kew has asked us to make clear that the National Heritage Act 1983 limits trustees’ abilities to “repatriate or otherwise dispose of” items in its collections, and that its herbarium will remain fully accessible to staff, students and visiting researchers.

November 18, 2023

In an article on the Cricket World Cup (sport, Nov 15) we reported that “it was rumoured that a few [England] players had to be helped on to the plane for their evening flight after the farewell do”. The Professional Cricketers Association has stated that: “The players were not drinking alcohol and they all left early to catch their flight in a professional manner.” We are happy to make this clear.

We wrongly said the UK’s October inflation figure had yet to be published (news, Nov 17). The figure of 4.6 per cent had been released on Nov 15.

November 6, 2023

We said the founders of Marks and Spencer were Zionist Jews (Comment, Nov 4). Michael Marks was a Zionist Jew; Thomas Spencer was not Jewish.

We said Frank Sinatra sang My Way at Government House in Nairobi in 1952 (Comment, Nov 4). In fact Sinatra’s performance did not include the song, which was not released until 1969.

November 4, 2023

Our obituary for Jennifer White Shah (Register, Nov 2) was wrongly illustrated with a photo of Nanette Newman. We apologise for the error.

October 31, 2023

We said Andy McDonald MP chanted, “Between the river and the sea, Palestine will be free,” at a rally (news, Oct 30). In fact he said, “Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.” We apologise for the error.

October 28, 2023

The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is in Glasgow, not Edinburgh as we wrongly suggested (Times2, Oct 26).

October 27, 2023

We said a case on the legality of the Rwanda scheme would be heard by the European Court of Human Rights next month (Comment, Oct 26). In fact the case will be heard by the UK Supreme Court in November: a related case may be put before the ECHR at a later date.

October 26, 2023

An opinion column referred to reports that women in labour in Scotland might no longer be offered Entonox for pain relief (Magazine, Oct 21). NHS Scotland has informed us that no such proposal is being considered. We are happy to put this on record.

October 20, 2023

We wrongly said life expectancy In Scotland had fallen by 4.4 years over the past decade (leading article, Oct 18). The latest National Records of Scotland figures for life expectancy at birth in Scotland show a decrease of 0.1 years between 2010-12 and 2020-22.

A Thunderer column on “the death of handwriting” (Comment, Oct 18) wrongly said Ofqual had given permission for some GCSE exams to be taken on laptops. In fact the regulator has yet to see detailed proposals from the AQA exam board. We are happy to make this clear.

October 17, 2023

A headline said “Pret’s food goes up five times more than rivals” (News, Sep 27). The article compared price rises on specific Pret a Manger items with the average rise in takeaway sandwiches over the last year. Pret a Manger says its average price rise was substantially less than the headline suggested. We are happy to make this clear..

October 13, 2023

The protester who threw glitter on Sir Keir Starmer was from People Demand Democracy, not Make Votes Count as we wrongly said (comment, Oct 12).

October 12, 2023

Akshata Murty is now paying UK taxes on worldwide income because she no longer claims the “remittance basis”, but she has not given up her non-dom status as we wrongly said (News, Sep 28).

October 11, 2023

We said a video appearance by Andrey Kurkov at the Lviv BookForum was cancelled (News, Oct 7). In fact the event went ahead despite online protests.

October 4, 2023

We said a doctor was paid £7,853 to cover a shift at the Walton Centre, a neurology unit in Liverpool (News, Oct 2). The hospital now says it misinterpreted The Times freedom of information request, and that the highest rate paid for a 24-hour shift was £2,840.

October 2, 2023

A Thunderer column on the cost of net zero cited findings from a report by Civitas (Comment, Sep 27). Civitas has since withdrawn the report, which was found to contain factual errors.

The Scottish government has not published plans to massively expand cage capacity for farmed salmon, as we wrongly said (Times Earth, Sep 21). A statement in the same article that farmed salmon live short, unhealthy lives reported the view of some environmentalists and we are happy to make this clear.

Mrs Justice Roberts was determining the mental capacity of Sudiksha Thirumalesh to challenge doctors’ views about her treatment, not imposing an anonymity order as we wrongly said. The wide-ranging transparency order governing the case had already been imposed by Mr Justice Francis and was not in issue (Corrections & Clarifications, Sep 27).

September 30, 2023

An article on the Conscious Advertising Network (CAN) referred to “the campaign’s boycotts” of advertising platforms (news, Aug 21). The claim that CAN organises boycotts was made by a group of Conservative MPs. CAN says it has never organised or called for boycotts and the allegation is untrue. We are happy to make this clear.

September 28, 2023

XLCC plans to produce subsea electricity cables that would incur power losses of only 3 per cent per 620 miles, not 62 miles as we wrongly stated (“Subsea cable factory lays out £1.4bn bid”, business, Sep 26). The mistake was due to an editing error.

September 26, 2023

An anonymity order in the case of Sudiksha Thirumalesh was imposed by Mrs Justice Roberts, not Mr Justice Roberts as we wrongly said (news, Sep 23).

We wrongly said that the UK’s first vegetarian restaurant was on Carnaby Street in the 1960s (news, Sep 23). In fact vegetarian restaurants have existed here for more than a century. A photograph with the same article showed a Carnaby Street fashion event in Paris, not the street itself.

September 22, 2023

We wrongly said that British tourists need an international driving permit to drive in Spain (World News, Sep 16), although some fines have been issued in error by local police.

September 20, 2023

We said the EU was working on an agreement that meant each member state would take a minimum of 30,000 migrants annually, and that richer member states would have to accept up to 120,000 migrants per year (news, Sep 13 & 15). In fact those minimum and maximum figures would apply across EU members, with the larger states taking a greater share.

August 28, 2023

Extracts from Unstoppable by Mark Hughes (Sport, Aug 20 & 21) were abridged and edited for serialisation, not taken verbatim from the published book. Online versions of the extracts have since been amended to reflect the author’s exact wording throughout.

August 26, 2023

In an article first published on December 19, 2022, under the headline “Labour selects miners scandal lawyer”, we incorrectly suggested that Jerry Hague, a prospective Labour Party candidate, had in 2010 been found guilty of professional misconduct for dishonestly misleading sick ex-miners seeking compensation for industrial injuries. We incorrectly suggested he had done so by perpetrating a scam against them when improperly deducting monies from their compensation. We accept that this allegation is false. Whilst Mr Hague did make admissions to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal of professional failings, they concerned the failure to provide better information to clients under professional practice rules and did not concern dishonesty, which was never alleged against him. We further accept that we omitted from the article that the Tribunal concluded that Mr Hague, and his firm Graysons, did not act unethically and had provided a good high level of professional service to their clients. We apologise to Mr Hague for these errors and for the distress caused and have agreed to pay him substantial damages and costs.

August 21, 2023

The number of 18-year-olds in receipt of free school meals who have been accepted by universities this year has risen by about 2,000, not fallen sharply as we said (leading article, Aug 17).

The plan for Covid boosters to be made available for anyone to buy is not the result of a rule change (news, Aug 18). We are happy to make this clear.

August 16, 2023

We said in a headline that leaving money to charity could be a “win” for the deceased’s loved ones (Money, Aug 5). While the course of action outlined in the article would lead to a reduction in the amount (and rate) of inheritance tax paid it would not result in a net gain for the deceased’s heirs. We are happy to make this clear.

August 12, 2023

We said Barnton Bunker was built for the late Queen in the event of nuclear war (News, Aug 9). While the owners say this was rumoured, there is no evidence it was the case.

August 11, 2023

We wrongly attributed new judicial guidance on judges’ conduct to HM Court and Tribunals Service (news, Aug 5).

August 5, 2023

We said in a headline that British companies were exporting key equipment to Russia “despite sanctions” (business, Jul 31). We are happy to make clear that Hill & Smith PLC and its subsidiary companies have never had a direct customer relationship with, or provided equipment to, any sanctioned entity in Russia.

August 3, 2023

An article headlined “Radcliffe: Trust children to transition”, published on April 13, 2023, reported comments made by three High Court judges in 2020 that children aged 13 and under would be highly unlikely to be able to give their competent consent for treatment to begin their transition. This was misleading as to the current legal position in light of a subsequent ruling by the Court of Appeal which found that it was inappropriate for the High Court to reach such general age-related conclusions. This correction has been published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation.

August 2, 2023

In “Post Office scandal: Fujitsu staff ‘complicit in cover-up” (News, Aug 2) we wrongly published an image of Simon Henderson. We apologise for the error.

July 21, 2023

We said in a headline that Elizabeth Winkler’s recent book claimed Shakespeare was a woman. (T2, Jul 7). Ms Winkler has asked us to make clear that her book explores various theories, including the possibility of a woman’s hand in the plays, while leaving readers to make up their own minds.

July 20, 2023

A 41-gun salute to honour the Queen’s birthday was performed by members of the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery, not the Honourable Artillery Company as a caption wrongly said (news, Jul 18).

July 8, 2023

In the obituary for Paul Rendall (June 14) we referred to some post-rugby match high jinks in which Rendall donned a judge’s wig and “passed sentence” on his friend Jeff Probyn. We now understand that the incident involved another rugby player and not Mr Probyn. We apologise for the mistaken identity.

July 4, 2023

The MCC member whose photograph was used with our article “Do MCC members feel part of the problem?” (Sport, June 29) was not one of those who spoke to our journalist about the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket report. We are happy to make this clear.

July 3, 2023

In reporting evidence given in the criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell (News, December 2, 2021), we made a wrongful allegation about Emmy Tayler. We accept that this was not a correct account and apologise sincerely to Ms Tayler for the harm and upset caused to her. We have agreed to pay damages and legal costs.

We said that John Morris had been the longest-serving Welsh MP in history (Obituary, June 7). In fact David Lloyd George served three more years.

June 8, 2023

We reported that In the Style’s stock had fallen 99.6 per cent in the past year and its founder had announced plans to enter compulsory liquidation (Times 2, June 7). In fact it is Itsarm, the former parent company of In the Style, that made the announcement after the fall in its share price.

June 5, 2023

Raymond Simonson is not known as Ray and is chief executive of JW3, not the Jewish Museum as we wrongly said (news, Jun 3). We are sorry for the errors.

May 29, 2023

Vernon Kay is not a party in a court case over planning permission for a cabin near his home (news, May 26). We are happy to make this clear.

We stated that an indicative from Lecram Holdings valued Purplebricks at £153 million, rather than £1.53 million (business, May 28). We apologise for the error.

May 16, 2023

We suggested on November 21, 2022, that Dinah Rose KC had been ruled against for recklessness by the Bar Standards Board. This was incorrect. The Board made no ruling against her and found no evidence of recklessness. We accept that under the constitutional principles which she cited, the Bar rules did not allow her to refuse a brief for the Cayman Islands government in a case concerning the right to same-sex marriage. The article was therefore misleading. We apologise to Ms Rose for the distress caused, and have agreed to pay her substantial damages and legal costs.

May 11, 2023

In “Clock ticking on Wasps’ new start” (sport, May 10) we mistakenly reported that The Wasps Legends Charitable Foundation was thought to have provided working capital when the club was bought out of administration. It did not. We apologise for the error.

We reported the results of polling by River Action UK (“Tackling river pollution could bring flood of votes”, news, Apr 25). We have since been made aware that YouGov gave the charity access to its polling panel on the understanding that results would not be made public, as they were not properly weighted and the questions were not approved by YouGov. We are happy to make this clear.

April 19, 2023

Sir Nicholas Bonsor served as chairman of the British Field Sports Society, not the British Association for Shooting and Conservation as we wrongly said (Obituary, Apr 8).

On February 24 we reported that Ronesans was the constructor of a 12-storey residence in Antakya that collapsed in the earthquake. This was incorrect and we apologise for the error. The 12-storey residence was in fact constructed by an entity that has no connection to Ronesans Holding.

February 28, 2023

Michael Rosen has asked us to correct or clarify a number of points in his interview (Weekend, Feb 25). He did not use the words “sensitivity reader”. While he said he would not himself now use the words “fat” and “ugly”, he did not comment on whether they should be in other books for children. He was re-enacting cowboy films a few years after the Holocaust, not “a couple of decades”. He did not say he had worked with the Dahl family. His YouTube readings have had 128.5 million views, not 300-400 million. He has done what he can to get antisemitic “remixes” of his videos removed from YouTube. His wife is a trainee case worker, not an immigration lawyer. We are happy to put the record straight and apologise for the mistakes.

We wrongly said that the Winnie-the-Pooh books had fallen out of copyright (Saturday Review, Feb 25). In fact AA Milne’s books Winnie-the-Pooh, The House at Pooh Corner, When We Were Very Young and Now We Are Six all remain in copyright in the UK and much of the rest of the world.

February 20, 2023

Our brief summary of a news story on house prices was unclear, wrongly suggesting they had risen only £14 in a year (Feb 20).

February 19, 2023

We reported that the rower Miriam Payne, 23, had set a new Atlantic record (Feb 18).

In fact the median house price rose 43.3 per cent from $628,000 at the start of the pandemic to $900,000 in October 2021, and has since fallen 12.2 per cent to $790,000.

February 8, 2023

On January 26 we reported that Tim Martin, of JD Wetherspoon, was criticised for telling his employees to “go to work at Tesco” while pubs were closed during the pandemic. Mr Martin told employees that supermarkets needed staff in the pandemic, that staff offered that work could take it and that they would be given priority at JD Wetherspoon should they return. We are happy to make that clear and apologise to JD Wetherspoon and Mr Martin for the error.

January 26, 2023

We are happy to put this on record and apologise for the mistake.

January 13, 2023

The headline and picture captions that accompanied an article published on January 11 (Business) incorrectly stated that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is involved in a High Court case over cancelled PPE deals and that the Church was awarded a £100 million contract.

January 9, 2023

We wrongly referred to the crown prince of Sweden (leading article, Jan 7). The heir apparent to the Swedish throne is Crown Princess Victoria.

January 5, 2023

We said that nearly half the ski runs in Zermatt were closed (news, Jan 3). In fact the closed slopes are “off-piste” runs. More than 240km of slopes are open, including the downhill runs to the village. We are happy to make this clear.
