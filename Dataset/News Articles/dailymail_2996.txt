The duo made precious memories at the world premiere in celebration of the sequel.

The new Dune sequel takes place immediately after the first film ended, when Paul (Timothee) and his mother joined forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the rest of the desert-dwelling Fremen to get revenge against the evil House Harkonnen, whose members have killed most of his family and friends.

The film was originally scheduled for a late October 2023 release, before being pushed back to November and finally shuffled all the way back to March of this year following the dual writers and actors strikes.

The sequel was co-produced with Legendary Entertainment in addition to Warner Bros. Film Group.

Timothee Chalamet will be reprising his role as Paul Atreides, the duke of House Atreides. Meanwhile Zendaya returns as Chani, a young Fremen woman.

Dune: Part One and Part Two are based on Frank Herbert's novel of the same name, which was originally published in 1965.

The official logline for Dune: Part 2 reads: 'Paul faces a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.'

The first feature received positive reviews from critics, and it currently holds an 83 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
