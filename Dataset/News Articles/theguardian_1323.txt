Jannik Sinner sealed his second successive tournament victory with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Alex de Minaur in the ABN AMRO Open final in Rotterdam.

Sinner, in action this week for the first time since winning the Australian Open, dropped just one set across the entire competition and hit 23 winners against his Australian opponent, bouncing back from giving up a break advantage in both sets.

The 12th tour-level title of his career will on Monday lift Sinner, who has now won 15 consecutive matches, to No 3 in the ATP rankings, making history as the first Italian man in history to climb so high.

Elsewhere, the 23-year-old wildcard Facundo Díaz Acosta finished a magnificent run at his home Argentina Open by beating third seed Nicolas Jarry 6-3, 6-4 to walk away with the trophy and his first ATP Tour title.
