There's more monkey business afoot at Fota Wildlife Park after it welcomed a new endangered species recently.

A François' langur monkey was born on November 22 to mother Mei and dad Shinobi, the park announced yesterday.

It is the first time this type of monkey has been born at the Co. Cork park.

The François' langur monkey is classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The monkey's mother, Mei, who was born in 2016, and her younger sister Kaili, who was born in 2018, made their journey to Fota Wildlife Park from the UK's Twycross Zoo in September last year as part of a European Endangered Breeding Programme (EEP).

Teresa Power, lead ranger at Foot Wildlife Park, said they hope the birth of this baby will help 'raise awareness about the critical need for conservation efforts'.
