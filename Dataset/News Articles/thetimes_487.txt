Eat more veg (you don’t have to be vegan) and switch to reusable coffee cups

In France there’s a new law preventing retailers from selling most fruit and veg in plastic. Here, our supermarkets still seem hell-bent on shrink-wrapping cucumbers and encasing mushrooms in plastic boxes. We must stand firm. Invest in a set of re-usable cotton-mesh produce bags (wildandstone.com). Take them with you to the supermarket and only buy loose.

Sixty per cent of all calories in the human diet are provided by just three crops: rice, wheat and maize. This creates vast monocultures that often sacrifice forests and deplete soil health. Nature is all about the opposite, biodiverse ecosystems (lots of species of flora and fauna). Our shopping baskets should be as diverse as possible too.
