Splatoon 3 is finally here after new details were revealed during a Nintendo Direct in August. We absolutely loved our time with the game, calling it “best entry in the series to date” in our review.

Not only do players have a suite of new features to look forward to, such as an updated Splatfest game mode and the introduction of a card game, but also returning features such as the co-operative “Salmon Run” and of course, team turf battles.

Splatoon 3 will be moving away from Inkopolis, with a new hub world called “Splatsville” acting as the player’s new home to take part in different game modes, including “Splatzones”, “tower control”, “rainmaker” and “clam blitz” on rotation.

Another new addition to Splatoon 3 is a new story mode titled “Return of the Mammalians”. Players will be able to take control of Agent 3 and fight against an evil army as part of a squad known as the “Squidbeak Splatoon”.

Splatoon 3 is available to purchase now from most major retailers. To find out how to get the best deals on Splatoon 3 for the Nintendo Switch, then keep reading the rest of the article below.
