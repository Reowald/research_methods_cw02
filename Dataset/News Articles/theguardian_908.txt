Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, will join us to discuss their new book, Head North.

Since taking up their respective posts in 2017, Burnham and Rotheram have been vocal about the challenges of modern British politics, and the failed attempts at ‘levelling up’ by successive Tory administrations. Their new book makes a compelling argument that the ‘Westminster knows best’ decision-making approach is not working. How can we spread political and economic power, and prosperity throughout the UK? Can we go beyond the Westminster bubble to push forward a fairer future for all?

Burnham and Rotheram will be in conversation with the Guardian’s north of England editor, Helen Pidd. They will outline their ambitious and united vision for a Britain we deserve, exploring how the devolution of power could deliver more and reimagine our country beyond the central Westminster system. This livestreamed event is a unique opportunity to hear from the two mayors and also ask your questions.
