The pair were spotted buying charcoal chicken from a restaurant before heading to a park to enjoy it away from Skye Suites, where the show's producers could easily spot them.

Such clandestine meet-ups are against the show's regulations, which prohibit cast members from interacting off-camera to prevent untelevised drama.

On the flip side, Tim spent breaks from filming doing routine tasks such as gym visits and grocery shopping.

As previously reported by Daily Mail Australia, Lauren and Sara's friendship blossomed off-screen, an aspect that will be unveiled as the series progresses.

Sara opened up about their connection: 'It was at the first dinner party where we bonded over discussing Jack and what happened with Jack. Our personalities clicked instantly. Lauren's wit complements our outspoken natures.'

'You'll see a lot of what happens throughout the series is me and Lauren tag teaming other people and pulling out their bad behaviour, but hopefully you start to see our friendship unfold soon because Lauren and I are still very much besties.'

During the dinner party on Wednesday's show, Sara repeatedly interrupted Tim's attempt to voice his disappointment over her cancelling dates, leading to other contestants pleading with Sara to let Tim speak.

Sara ignored them all, continuing to get defensive until she called into question the dates Tim claimed she had cancelled on.

Tim was visibly frustrated by this and quickly amended: 'Nah, I was like, "You're booked out from 2pm onwards, wear something nice".'
