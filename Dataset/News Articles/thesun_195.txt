Callum & Molly have HUGE cash offers on table & will be the real winners of Love Island All Stars

The 32-year-old reality star has been keeping fans updated with her pregnancy journey over the last few months.

At the weekend, Kendall shared snaps of her blossoming baby bump in a white see-through strappy gown.

She stood in a dimly lit room and cradled her growing stomach.

Going underwear free in the sheer dress, the mum-to-be glanced at the camera before she candidly looked away.

Kendall's followers were full of compliments, with one writing: "So beautiful you're glowing."

A second posted: "Absolutely beautiful… not long now Kendall."

Kendall and footballer partner Andrew Hughes are soon going to become parents for the first time.

Back in September the couple shared the exciting news on Instagram.

Kendall looked amazing in a white bikini as she cradled her growing bump, and Andrew held their scan.

“Mummy & Daddy.

“After 5 amazing years together we couldn’t be happier to say WE’RE HAVING A BABY!!," they wrote.

Kendall is best known for her stint on Love Island.

The star only lasted five days before she was booted out of the villa.

The former retail manager entered on day one and coupled up with Niall Aslam.

By day two she recoupled with Adam Collard.

But her villa experience was cut short and she was dumped on day six when the Geordie lad picked Rosie Williams.
