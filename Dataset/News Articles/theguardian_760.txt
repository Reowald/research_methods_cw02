Kazna Asker Asker was the first designer to show a hijab on the catwalk at Central Saint Martins in 2022, as part of her collection for the final MA show. Sheffield-based, her first contribution at London fashion week came last season with a film called Fight For Me Sheffield. This season comes a collection called What Are We Fighting For?. A talent who brings design and community-organising together, Asker – who is British-Yemeni – uses her brand as a platform. “It continues the love letter to my local community, as well as representing the voices that are often overlooked,” she says.
