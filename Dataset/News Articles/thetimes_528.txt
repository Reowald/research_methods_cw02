Skiing is one of the most glamorous leisure sports (it’s certainly chicer than fly-fishing), all snug all-in-ones, fur collars and fluoro headbands. For evidence look no further than the 1963 film The Pink Panther, starring David Niven and Claudia Cardinale, filmed in Cortina d’Ampezzo in Italy and featuring some of the most stylish ski and après-ski wear to have rolled about in the snow.

One’s only concern is that they may have been rather cold, but that is no longer a worry with new technical fabrics that ensure a sleek cosiness (those thickly padded salopettes that make you look like the Michelin man — the stuff of our school ski trip nightmares — are no more). So before you head up the mountains, check out our thoughtfully curated list of this year’s coolest skiwear. Just think of that full Fendi snow set (skis and goggles included) while you carve down a black run.
