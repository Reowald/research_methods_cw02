Organisers discuss moving men’s final to Saturday and concluding tournament with women’s showpiece from 2026, to avoid late finishes on Sunday night

Australian Open organisers are considering concluding the tournament with the women’s singles final rather than the men’s, in what would be a significant shift from tradition at the sport’s four grand-slam tournaments.

The proposal comes after another late finish on the last day of this year’s event. Jannik Sinner did not complete his successful comeback from two sets down against Daniil Medvedev until 11.30pm, meaning that many television viewers in Australia had gone to bed before the end.

This is part of a long series of late-running matches at Melbourne Park. The 2022 final between Rafael Nadal and Medvedev finished at 1.11am, while the latest finish in a men’s final was in 2012, when Nadal and Novak Djokovic’s near six-hour encounter finished at 1.37am.
