Uma Thurman turned the sidewalks into her own runway as she stepped out with her youngest child Luna in New York City on Saturday.

The Pulp Fiction icon, 53, looked effortlessly stylish in a chic ensemble while taking a stroll alongside her daughter, 10, who she shares with ex-fiancé, French financier Arpad Busson, in the Big Apple.

Rocking a white turtleneck, navy sweater and black trousers, the star showcased her natural beauty by going virtually makeup free.

She bundled up in a fashionable black wool jacket and carried a shopping tote from what appeared to be a recent retail therapy session.

The Big Apple outing comes after Uma walked the same red carpet as her ex Ethan Hawke 20 years after their shock split.

The former couple both showed up at the 40th-anniversary screening of Sophie's Choice at the Museum of Modern Art, alongside the film's stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol.

During the event, Thurman opted for a solo appearance in front of the cameras, while Hawke was spotted teaming up with Cate Blanchett, seemingly avoiding each other.

Uma and Ethan exchanged vows in 1998 after crossing paths on the set of the sci-fi film Gattaca in 1996.

The couple welcomed two children: Maya, now 25, and Levon, 22.

Their romance ended in 2003 amid speculation that Ethan had been unfaithful with their children's nanny, Ryan Shawhughes.

Despite the actor's denial of the affair, he later publicly started dating Shawhughes after finalizing his divorce from Thurman in 2005.

In 2008, Ethan and Ryan tied the knot and went on to become parents to two daughters: Clementine, 15, and Indiana, 12.

During her initial interview post-divorce with Oprah Winfrey in October 2005, Uma openly acknowledged that the separation took a toll on her self-esteem, leaving it 'pretty mangled.'

She characterized it as 'excruciating' and said communication with Ethan remained 'very difficult'.

While not confirming the affair rumors, she did imply that there was a sense of 'betrayal' between them.

This marked Thurman's second venture into marriage, having previously been wed to Academy Award-winner Gary Oldman from 1990 to 1992.

Meanwhile, Uma recently starred in comedy-thriller The Kill Room alongside her daughter Maya.

It marked the first time the Kill Bill vet appeared alongside her eldest child in a feature film.
