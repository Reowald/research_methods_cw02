For many of the millions of Brits visiting Mallorca annually in the 1970s, the main interaction with locals was ordering more cervezas

In the 1970s the photographer Trevor Clark was one of the first to capture the Great British package holiday in all its beachball-bouncing, piña colada-swigging glory. Born in 1933, Clark, from east London, made his name in the Swinging Sixties shooting the Beatles and Rolling Stones. In 1970 he moved to Mallorca to capitalise on the growing demand for holiday brochure shoots: by 1972 more than a third of British overseas tourists were off to sunny Spain. Clark died in 2018. His son, Jake, has curated a book of those sun-drenched shoots.
