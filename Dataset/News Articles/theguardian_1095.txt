Aircraft parked on an illegal airstrip in Venezuelan territory near Yanomami land in Roraima state, Brazil. The Brazilian military reduced operations in mid-2023 and stopped transporting fuel for the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama)’s helicopters to forward bases in the reservation, limiting their range across the vast territory. The air force has not enforced a no-fly zone, despite Lula ordering it to do so, and the navy is not doing enough to blockade the rivers that are the miners’ main access routes, three Ibama officials said.
