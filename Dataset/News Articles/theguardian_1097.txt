Members of Sisters of the Valley and Alehli Paz, 34, a chemist and marijuana researcher working with the group, take care of cannabis plants on a rooftop at their farm on the outskirts of a village in central Mexico. Under the guidance of Paz, the Sisters grow a modest crop. They pot plants in old paint buckets and place them in rows between four unfinished concrete walls on a rooftop. Once grown, the Sisters move the plants to walled-off private gardens they identified with help from supportive older women in the community
