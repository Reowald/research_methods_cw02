A British man jailed in a hellhole Siberian prison is "clearly next" on Vladimir Putin's hit list, according to an expert.

Last Friday (February 16) Russian opposition leader and long-time Putin critic Alexei Navalny died in prison.

Russian authorities claimed Navalny suffered "sudden death syndrome". Navalnyâ€™s spokesperson claimed he was "murdered" and reports today suggest his body was spotted in a morgue covered in bruises.

There are now concerns for Vladimir Kara-Murza, 42, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year on trumped up treason charges. Kara-Murza, who holds both British and Russian passports, was an opposition political activist in Moscow.

Kara-Murza was outspoken against the war in Ukraine and was a close aide to Boris Nemtsov, a politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015. Dr Stepan Stepanenko, head of the Forward Strategy foreign policy think-tank, reckons it is "clear" that Kara-Murza - who grew up and studied in Britain - is "next" on Putin's kill list.

He told The Sun: "Vladimir Kara-Murza is imprisoned on false charges, he is very ill and following Navalny, it is clear that he is next.

"He may even die before he is murdered. Kara-Murza's battle is not just against his captors but against time itself. Stricken with polyneuropathy, the grim reality is that he may never reunite with his family."

Kara-Murza survived two poisonings in 2015 and 2017, leaving him with a nerve disorder. His wife spoke out over the weekend following the Navalny news, saying her "husband's life is in danger".

Evgenia told the BBC: "I have been afraid for my husband's life since at least 2015, since that first call that I received about Vladimir collapsing in Moscow and going into [a] coma with multiple organ failure for no reason at all.

"I've been sleeping with my phone since, dreading yet another call of that sort. I believe that my husband's life is in danger, as are the lives of many other political prisoners in Russian prisons."
