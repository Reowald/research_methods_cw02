The football world moves fast. Maybe faster than ever. That was best illustrated with the story of the year, the dramatic rise and collapse of the Super League. It threatened to change the game, before it all changed in the space of two days.

An issue is that it can be difficult to keep track of everything, to filter what’s actually important from what makes the headlines. The cycle has never been more relentless. With that in mind, I’m going to try and add a bit of ‘pause’ to the play, as Pep Guardiola might say.

I send out a new weekly email every Friday at 12pm, called ‘Reading the Game’, that will seek to make sense of what’s happening in football. It will offer analysis of the biggest stories, the details behind the scenes, as well as insights and anecdotes that will be exclusive to subscribers.

There will also be a bit of entertainment, to test your knowledge. Every week I’ll be setting brainteasers to give you something to mull over on a Friday afternoon.

Over time, there will even be the opportunity to win prizes out of that. We can promise you that, after a while, you certainly won’t want to miss those.
