With the far right fast becoming part of the European political mainstream, what are the consequences for the continent and beyond?

In power in Italy and Finland, negotiating to form the next Dutch government and surging in the polls from Germany to Portugal and Austria to France - Europe’s far right is advancing at an alarming rate.

Ahead of June’s elections for the European parliament and with national elections due in several EU member states in 2024, polls suggest far right, anti-establishment and “anti-European” parties are heading for significant gains.

No longer languishing on the margins of the continent’s politics, what is the appeal of these parties, and how are they gaining respectability and power? What are the likely consequences of their advance - for the European parliament, for national capitals, and for key pillars of the EU’s agenda from climate action to enlargement and support for Ukraine?

In this livestreamed event, the Guardian’s Europe correspondent Jon Henley will join a panel of leading experts including the political analyst Catherine Fieschi, and Simon Hix of the European University Institute, to discuss the rising popularity and power of the far right, and the potential consequences for the EU.
