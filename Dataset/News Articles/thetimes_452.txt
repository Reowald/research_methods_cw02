Experts said the figure was a reminder of the importance of meeting agreed climate goals

The planet reached the limit above the industrial revolution set in 2015’s Paris agreement

Earth was 1.5C warmer over the past 12 months than before the industrial revolution, for the first time.

Experts said the milestone was a reminder of the urgent need to cut the carbon emissions driving climate change. The global average surface temperature anomaly has tipped over 1.5C for a month before, but never for as long as a year.

The number is hugely significant because it is the threshold that the UK and nearly 200 other countries agreed to hold global temperature rises to in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

However, the Paris deal’s goal will only be considered to have been missed when temperatures have been 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for about two decades.
