Jamie Redknapp has claimed that Manchester United midfielder Casemiro was fortunate not to be sent off for a foul against Luton Town.

Casemiro was booked for a late challenge on Luton's Amari'i Bell and United boss Erik ten Hag then elected to make a change at half time, with Scott McTominay replacing the Brazilian for the second half.

Redknapp stated that Casemiro was 'so lucky' that he wasn't dismissed.

Reacting to the decision to substitute Casemiro at half time, Redknapp said: 'This is a no brainer. Casemiro has already been booked.

'You can't go to ground and make challenges like this one. He gets so lucky here, watch his left foot. Mainoo will go and play in front of the back four.'

Casemiro has been booked in three of his last four Premier League appearances, having also been cautioned against Wolves and Aston Villa.

In addition to Casemiro, United also elected to take off Harry Maguire at the break, with Jonny Evans coming on.

They had also made a change just before half time as Victor Lindelof came on for the injured Luke Shaw.

United established a two goal lead as Rasmus Hojlund scored twice, but Carlton Morris reduced the deficit for Luton.
