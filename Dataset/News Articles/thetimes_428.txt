Long waits for elderly patients have led to fierce criticism of the NHS ALAMY

Jeremy Bowen writes that his mother, who is 86, had to wait for 20 hours on a hard chair in A&E (News Review, last week). This was cruel and inhumane, but sadly no surprise. NHS acute care has descended into a farce.

When my condition seriously worsened at 3am on New Yearâ€™s Eve, my daughter rang 999. She was told that the wait for an ambulance was 16 hours, followed by a wait of 50 hours in the A&E department. Such waiting times are not uncommon in Birmingham.

The condition turned out to be self-limiting and I survived, but it was not thanks to any medical intervention. The NHS acute care response is abysmal and can no longer be tolerated.
