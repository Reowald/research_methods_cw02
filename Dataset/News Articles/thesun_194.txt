MICHELLE Keegan made sure her granddad Michael celebrated his 90th birthday in style with a huge boozy bash in his honour.

With Mark and Michelle first heading to the property for a romantic getaway, and Mark DJing their lunch party event, the trip soon turned into a family affair.

Michael donned a classic kilt to celebrate his Scottish heritage, with the family staying at the lodges on site and partying in the function room, according to Daily Mail.

They invited close family and friends to join them in the celebration, with Michelle later sharing clips from the party online.

Among the decorations was a huge banner with photos from Michael’s life, including photos of him as a baby and a dashing young man.

Across their time together, the group spent time with the estate’s on-site horses, and enjoyed some special family time at fancy restaurants.

Michelle shared a photograph of her cuddled up with her granddad, who was enjoying a cold pint of Guinness.

Alongside the pic, she declared: “Let the weekend celebrations begin. Happy 90th birthday grandad.”

Unfortunately Michelle had to end her time on Sunday and head to London in time to glam up for the BAFTAs, where she checked into the fancy Savoy hotel to get changed in her glam squad.
