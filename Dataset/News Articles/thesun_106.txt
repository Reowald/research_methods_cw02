And she knows what she is doing in the water, as she is also a certified scuba diver.

Barbara recently starred in a music video for Latin music legend Marc Anthony — who used to be married to J-Lo.

In the video for song Punta Cana, Barbara is seen showing off her spiciest salsa moves.

Former couple J-Lo and Marc have twins Max and Emme together and while they are on amicable terms, Jennifer has made no mention of her ex's nuptials to new wife Nadia Ferreira on social media and didn't attend the ceremony.

Nadia, 23, is a former Miss Universe contestant and she became engaged to Marc eight months ago.

The marriage - Marc's fourth - took place at the Perez Art Museum in Miami last year, with David Beckham acting as best man.

Meanwhile guests included Salma Hayek, and Romeo Santos.
