A holiday before your due date and post-marriage getaways are a popular way of celebrating the good news of tremendous milestones, and you don’t even need to leave the shores of the UK for the most memorable of minimoons and babymoons.

Hidden gems that don’t break the bank are on the doorstep for parents-to-be ready to start nesting and newlyweds still firmly in the honeymoon phase after tying the knot. Think rural hideaways, cosy cottage stays and romantic weekends in the city. Travelling flight free to the intimate settings that pepper Cornwall, the Scottish Highlands and York will allow you to find a very special type of romantic, British charm.

So, treat yourself on a “moon” to our isle’s white sands, woodland delights and world-class spas or simply indulge in British classics at tables for two during off-grid breaks. From sea view suites to unique glamping pods and lavish country estates, here are The Independent’s top picks for a romantic holiday to celebrate milestone moments this year.
