Neil Hobday posed as Peter Whyte to approach residents whose homes bordered the Menie Estate

A former project director for Donald Trump’s controversial Aberdeenshire golf resort has admitted that he regrets “to this day” trying to buy up the homes of residents.

Before Trump’s involvement became public, Neil Hobday posed as Peter Whyte — his middle names — to approach people whose homes bordered the Menie Estate. He told the residents, felt by Trump to be obstructing his planned £1 billion development, that he was looking for a holiday home.

Speaking about it for the first time on a new BBC Scotland podcast, Trumped, Hobday said he had been uncomfortable with the subterfuge and still regretted his actions.

Hobday, who quit as project director in 2010, said none of those he approached had been interested. “Absolutely not,” he said.
