Overview of the workshop

Designed for individuals who are thinking about becoming a non-executive director, the 'So You Want To Be A Non-Executive Director?' workshop looks at the duties and liabilities of being a non-exec, effective boardroom behaviour and how to go about getting that all-important first role, with advice on how to present your CV and tips on interview techniques.

The workshop is designed to be interactive and is run by recognised experts in their field. It is followed by an online networking session to give you the opportunity to meet informally with our speakers and fellow delegates.
