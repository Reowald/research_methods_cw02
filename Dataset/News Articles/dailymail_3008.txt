And on Thursday Variety confirmed that the star does in fact make an appearance in the sci-fi epic as she plays a major character from the franchise.

Lea Seydoux put on a racy display in a silver figure-hugging dress with cut-out sleeves and a sweetheart neckline.

The garment also featured a sheer detail and glowing train with the No Time To Die star pairing it with gold stilettos.

Letting her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders, the French beauty completed her outfit with an eye-catching silver necklace.

The new Dune sequel takes place immediately after the first film ended, when Paul (Timothee) and his mother joined forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the rest of the desert-dwelling Fremen to get revenge against the evil House Harkonnen, whose members have killed most of his family and friends.

The film was originally scheduled for a late October 2023 release, before being pushed back to November and finally shuffled all the way back to March of this year following the dual writers and actors strikes.

The sequel was co-produced with Legendary Entertainment in addition to Warner Bros. Film Group.
