"I don't know if you can really script it any better," said Iowa's Caitlin Clark after she brok the NCAA women’s basketball scoring record after scoring 49 points in her team’s 106-89 win over Michigan. Clark, who needed eight points to break the record previously held by Kelsey Plum, reached the threshold with a three-pointer from 35 feet. The 22-year-old only needed two minutes and 12 seconds to break the record before going on to set a single-game points record for Iowa. Clark now has 3,569 points in her career and can break more records with the AIAW major-college record of 3,649 being held by Lynette Woodard.
