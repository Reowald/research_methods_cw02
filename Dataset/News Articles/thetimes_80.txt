Barclays and HSBC are among the London-listed banks that are going to publish their latest results

Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Standard Chartered are about to update the market

Barclays leads the parade of Britain’s biggest banks reporting results this week, with City analysts tomorrow expecting a fall in annual pre-tax profit to £6.7 billion from £7 billion in 2022, knocked by restructuring charges that the lender is likely to suffer as part of a highly anticipated overhaul. Coimbatore Sundararajan Venkatakrishnan, its chief executive, will set out his revamp alongside the results and his plan will be studied closely by analysts and investors.

HSBC will publish its figures on Wednesday, when the Asia-focused lender is forecast to unveil record annual profits of $34 billion thanks to higher rates.
