Erik ten Hag has called on his Manchester United stars to become much more clinical if they want to get into the top four after almost letting a two-goal lead slip at Luton.

Rasmus Hojlund struck twice in the first seven minutes to put United in control but Luton dominated after Carlton Morris made it 2-1.

Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes all squandered opportunities to kill the match and were it not for the crossbar saving United from Ross Barkley’s header in stoppage time, this would have been two points dropped.

‘We didn’t take the chances,’ Ten Hag said.

‘I think we should have scored much more goals. After 2-0 [there were] big chances for Rasmus and Garnacho.

'When he started he didn't have so much luck… the disallowed goal against Brighton as one,' Ten Hag added.

'Those kinds of moments are very important when you come to a new league, especially as a striker, to build some confidence.
