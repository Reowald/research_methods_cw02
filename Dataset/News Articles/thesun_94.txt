There are 3,376 prison cells in Ireland and only 63 of these have screened off toilets.

Ireland’s prison system is experiencing a severe overcrowding crisis with 4,768 people behind bars, including 101 prisoners who are sleeping on mattresses on the floor.

These cramped conditions coupled with the lack of plop privacy are resulting in lock-up tensions.

Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said: "One of the things that is obvious is just how full prisons are.

"You’ve got people doubling up where they are supposed to be single cells – so you can see the issue regarding toilets.

“No matter who we are talking about, we need to be considering the dignity of the person.”

Currently, there are 56 in-cell screened off toilets in Limerick’s Female Prison in a section opened recently.

There are also seven cells with screened toilets in the Dochas Centre and some rooms in the open prisons including Loughan House, Shelton Abbey and the Grove at Castlerea Prison.

The Prison Service says it can’t introduce fully screened toilets owing to a lack of space to house so many inmates.

It also claim that screened toilets would impact on officers’ ability to monitor prisoners.

The Department of Justice said: “The pilot project aims to provide greater privacy to the cell user while maintaining the security of the cell occupants.”
