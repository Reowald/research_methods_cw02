Phuntsho Tshering is Bhutan’s glacier specialist and the only person authorised to climb the Himalayan country’s sacred mountains. He spends months away from home measuring the rapidly melting glaciers, while faithfully recording videos on his phone for his daughter, Yangchen.

Yangchen in turn has an inner dilemma. She prays that her father won’t disturb the Snow Lion, the mythical embodiment of the glacier which the Bhutanese believe could provoke a natural disaster. Meanwhile at school she is taught that the biggest threat to survival of the Snow Lion is not her father, but climate change
