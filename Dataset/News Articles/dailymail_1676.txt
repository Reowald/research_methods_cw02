Ben Kay's big moments from the game: Care's stunning start blew Wales away, Gatland's men couldn't catch up



DANNY'S BUZZING

Danny Care’s explosive start gave England a tempo which left Wales struggling to catch up. Care showed confidence and cheek to get the first try, catching Wales off guard when back pedalling in defence. His buzz is infectious. Long may it last.

HIBBARD HOWLER

Richard Hibbard will have nightmares about the throw which handed England the initiative for Luther Burrell’s try. England forced the hooker to throw long because of their pressure on the Welsh line. It went so far that England stole possession and set up the attack which led to the try.

CRYING SHAME

Miss of the match came from Wales on 50 minutes. In a rare decent counter-attack, Jamie Roberts had George North outside in space. Perhaps he tried to copy Billy Twelvetrees’ delicate try-making kick but North’s anguished cry said it all.

FANTASTIC FARRELL

It may be boring but those downfield punts by Owen Farrell helped England’s game management in that first half when Wales stayed in the match through Leigh Halfpenny’s place kicking.



The pair did not miss a shot at goal but Farrell’s overall kicking game was a key factor.

On the money: Owen Farrell's kicking display helped England on their way to victory at Twickenham

LANCASTER'S BUILDING

Stuart Lancaster’s triumphant punch said it all. His squad delivered and even late substitutions held up unlike in the Paris defeat by France.



This gives him something tangible — a first Triple Crown since 2003 — to show his team are making strides. Warren Gatland is too canny to be fazed by this, but Wales failed to spark. He took off Rhys Priestland for the last 18 minutes but did not have the same strength in depth.
