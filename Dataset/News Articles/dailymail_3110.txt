About savings platforms

A new wave of savings platforms have emerged in recent years which help savers keep track of their accounts more easily and move money into better rates after signing up.

They might not always offer the best rates on the market, but allow you to manage multiple accounts in one place. In some cases they offer exclusive deals that beat the market.

They also sometimes have sign-up bonuses that can help boost rates to make them better than what is on offer elsewhere and also offer Financial Services Compensation Scheme protection.

Two free to use savings platforms that have consistently offered deals on par with the best buys this year are Raisin UK* and Hargreaves Lansdown's Active Savings.*

The best deals on these platforms ca be found below.

Rival platforms include Flagstone, AJ Bell's Cash Savings Hub*, and Aviva Save.
