When the Roma arrived in 2019, it was a welcome change of direction from Ferrari — a celebration of the glorious, glamorous days of the 1950s and 1960s. An elegant and sophisticated design that moved away from aggressive supercars and their relentless pursuit of performance towards simpler, carefree times. Think Marcello and Sylvia in the Trevi Fountain.

Now Ferrari has launched the convertible version, the Spider. In many ways it makes the Roma seem more playful and gets you closer to living la dolce vita. It effectively replaces the Portofino M, which was starting to sit a little uncomfortably in the Ferrari model line-up, having already been replaced by the Roma Coupé and only surviving as a convertible option until the Spider came along. Interestingly, the Roma Spider does not have a folding hard top like its convertible predecessors but instead gets a fabric folding roof. This suits its retro aspirations and gives the car a distinct point of difference as an out-and-out cabriolet compared to its folding-hard-top stablemates, which try to be both coupé and convertible. Fittingly, the alfresco Roma is its first front-engined soft-top since the 1960s.
