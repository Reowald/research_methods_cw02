When embarking on digital transformation, universities often deploy strategies that serve the needs of the institution and its existing structures and processes. For many of the students and staff on the receiving end of such changes, the experience has been less than ideal. “Digital learning” is still often old content on a new platform, rather than being designed to enable optimal learning through personalized, digital self-access. On many campuses, staff and students still struggle daily with multiple systems to get simple administrative tasks done.

We contend that institutions would get a far better return on their digital investment by putting the needs of the people they serve at the center of technology efforts.

In a bid to understand what the people at the center of universities want from digital transformation, we undertook research with the people who experience it every day. Our latest study, conducted in collaboration with Times Higher Education (THE), includes more than 3,000 students and hundreds of teaching faculty and professional staff in eight geographies, and explores their wants and needs.
