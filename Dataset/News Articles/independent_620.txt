It’s the most wonderful time of the year, no not Christmas, another Call of Duty release window.

This year it’s a sort of half-reboot/half-remake of Modern Warfare III.

The game serves as a sequel to 2019’s Modern Warfare (which later spawned WarZone) and last year’s Modern Warfare II.

The game gets its official release on November 10 but eager fans can play before then…

How to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III in early access

Although the game gets its worldwide release on November 10, the game can be played for many from November 2 (Thursday.)

To play early all you have to do is preorder the digital edition of the game. It does not matter which edition of the game you preorder.

You can preorder the game for PS5, Xbox and PC here.
