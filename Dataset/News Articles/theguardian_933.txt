A desperate call for help from a home in suburban Minneapolis early on Sunday turned deadly for two police officers and a firefighter who were fatally shot at the scene, according to officials.

A suspect in the shooting also died, officials said.

The deaths of the two Burnsville police officers and the firefighter were confirmed by the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which represents public safety professionals in the state. A third officer was wounded in the shooting.

“Horrific news from Burnsville,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said in a post on Facebook. “While responding to a call of a family in danger, two police officers and one firefighter lost their lives, and other officers were injured.

“We must never take for granted the bravery and sacrifices our police officers and first responders make every day. My heart is with their families today and the entire state of Minnesota stands with Burnsville.”

City officials identified the slain officers as Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge, both 20. The firefighter was 40-year-old Adam Finseth, who was also a paramedic.

Officials said Finseth was killed while providing aid to Elmstrand and Ruge after they had been shot. The third officer shot was Sgt Adam Medlicott, and he was treated for wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening.

Details on how the shooting suspect died were not immediately released.

The shooting erupted in a tree-lined neighborhood with two-story homes. In its aftermath, the street was lined with SWAT vehicles, police cars, firefighters and ambulances.

Democratic congresswoman Angie Craig of Minnesota said in a statement that she had been in touch with the mayor, police chief and state officials to offer any federal resources needed.

“Today,” she said, “serves as another solemn reminder that those who protect our communities do so at great personal risk.”

Burnsville, a city of about 64,000, is located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of downtown Minneapolis.
