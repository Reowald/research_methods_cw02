Launched more than 12 years ago to a public that was somewhat sceptical about a baby Range Rover, the Evoque is now an important part of the Land Rover landscape. It’s the entry point to Range Rover ownership and is followed by the Velar, then the Range Rover Sport, right up to the heady heights and brandy-butter excess of the “big” Range Rover. The second-generation Evoque has been around for five years and, along with the Velar, spearheaded Gerry McGovern’s “reductive” design that can be seen now on all Range Rovers. The philosophy suits this elegant small SUV, which plies its trade mainly in city centres rather than muddy fields.

Land Rover has gone with the “if it ain’t broke …” adage for the latest facelift, with a tinker round the edges. It nails the Range Rover look and luxury, which has significant appeal for buyers, and even the entry-level “S” model has most of the usual creature comforts. The new model retains the trademark floating roof design and has Corinthian Bronze and Tribeca Blue launch colours, which suit the car well. Pixel LED headlights are sleek — but more importantly they are impressive tech, with matrix dimming to avoid dazzling the driver ahead and oncoming cars while still illuminating the the road.
