Believe it or not, wine knowledge — unlike the ability to roll Rs and wear a scarf with style — isn’t a French birthright. In Gérard Basset’s childhood home, the wine on the table was cheap and unremarkable, so he knew nothing when, working as a waiter in England, he was drafted in to help the sommeliers. It was a case of, “You’re French, you’ll do”, his son Romané says.

He became so interested that by the time he died, at the age of 61 in 2019, Basset had co-founded the Hotel du Vin hotel chain and won the title of World’s Best Sommelier. He was a Master of Wine (MW) and Master Sommelier (MS), and remains one of the very few people in the world to have achieved both. And all this from a starting point of not knowing his Château Plonk from his premier cru.
