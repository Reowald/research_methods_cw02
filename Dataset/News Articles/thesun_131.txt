A CLASSIC 'rust bucket' Mercedes that was found abandoned in a barn is now worth over £300,000 after a "perfect" restoration.

Alex Hirschi, a.k.a Supercar Blondie, travelled to Hungary to give her YouTube viewers a glimpse inside the process that brought the retro motor back to life.

In a video uploaded to her channel, Alex said she had been "tipped off" that some of the vehicles stashed in a remote barn in the Hungarian countryside could be worth top dollar.

Among the retro rides she found there was a Daimler that, she claimed, was used by the Royal Family and a Mercedes Pullman limo that was part of a special batch sent to Abu Dhabi.

However, the one she decided to save was a W111 model, which was produced between 1959 and 1971.

The car was loaded up onto a trailer to be taken to the workshop of restoration company Motor Classic, who specialise in saving wrecked and abandoned vehicles.

The whole thing was deep-cleaned and disassembled, with each individual part sent of to an in-house specialist team to be revived.

There's even a special chroming pool, where old parts can be brought back to a good-as-new condition and refitted exactly onto the chassis.

The Merc was then hand-painted after a preparation process that can take up to 300 hours.

Inside, the entire cabin was refitted and the seats reupholstered in hand-stitched leather covering a coconut shell base frame - yes it's actually made of coconut shells.

And of course the engine was thoroughly cleaned and re-engineered to get it running like a dream.

At the end of the process, Alex said: "It's time to see the final result.

"This is how you added hundreds of thousands...to a barn find rust bucket.

"I cannot believe the before and after...this is gorgeous."

She really wasn't wrong, wit the rusted, broken down old banger turned into a luxury saloon that wouldn't look out of place in a Bond film.

Best of all, Alex revealed that the car's value had now shot up to over £200,000.

Social media commenters loved the stunning transformation.

Another added: "Hard work and the finish is amazing."

And a third chipped in: "I love watching a diamond in the rough turn into a million-dollar gem."

It comes after an expert revealed four of the cheapest-to-run cars out there, including an EV that can do 150 miles on just £10 of charge.

Meanwhile, a driver shared how he transformed his car into a Rolls Royce lookalike using a £7 can and a screwdriver.
