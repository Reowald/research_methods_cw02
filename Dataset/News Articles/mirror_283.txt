Harry also spoke to GMA on Friday and praised his family, but refused to talk about his dad, King Charles' condition. He told the show their conversation "stays between me and him".

When asked how he found out about the King's condition, Harry explained: "I spoke to him." Host Will Reeve then asked: "And what did you do next?" Harry replied: "I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could."

Harry also comments that he feels lucky to have been able to visit his father following the diagnosis, having made the short visit back to London last week. He said: "Look I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him I'm grateful for that." When asked if the diagnosis could have a "reunifying effect" amid their feud, Harry said he is certain it will.

"Yeah, I'm sure. Throughout all these families I see it on a day-to-day basis the strength of the family unit coming together. I think any illness, any sickness brings families together."
