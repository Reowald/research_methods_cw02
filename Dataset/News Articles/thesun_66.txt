Six Nations 2024 favourites

Will the 2024 competition be a two-horse race?

The bookies certainly think so with heavyweights France and Ireland leading the betting markets.

Fabien Galthie's France - the number 4-ranked team in the world - are looking to wrestle back the title from Ireland having won the tournament in 2022 and finished second last year.

The French will be equally motivated to avenge their disappointing World Cup campaign having been knocked out by eventual winners South Africa in the quarter-final stage.

Some have labelled this group of players as potentially 'the best French team in history' with the likes of captain Gregory Aldritt, breakthrough star Louis Bielle-Biarrey and great fly-half hope Matthieu Jalibert.

It's a similar story for Ireland, who will want to put their World Cup disappointment in the rearview mirror.

Ireland were the number 1 ranked side in world rugby and dominated in 2023, winning the Six Nations Grand Slam and embarking on a 17-Test winning run.

However, Andy Farrell's side were defeated by New Zealand at the quarter-final stage, and bid farewell to the talismanic Johnny Sexton.

Peter O'Mahony will lead Ireland's defence as captain, but despite Sexton and Keith Earls departures - many of those who romped to Six Nations success are available for selection.

England are there or thereabouts at 11/2, but it would take a significant improvement for Steve Borthwick’s side to claim the trophy for the first time since 2020.

They did, however, progress to the semi-finals of the World Cup despite sacking former coach Eddie Jones less than a year before the tournament began.

Six Nations 2024 betting tips

Let’s take a look at some of the best outright bets you can place at this year’s Six Nations tournament.

Outright winner - France (11/10 bet365)

It's difficult to look past France, especially with second-favourites Ireland having to adjust to the absence of Johnny Sexton. All signs pointed towards Fabien Galthie's side winning the 2023 World Cup were it not for their heartbreaking one-point defeat to South Africa. Yes, scrum-half Antoine Dupont is absent, but the French squad is packed with talent and they are more than capable of claiming a second championship in three years.

Bet on France to win the Six Nations outright at 11/10 with bet365

Top tryscorer - Damian Penaud (7/2 with bet365)

Perhaps the most prolific winger playing for the tournament favourites - what's not to like? Damian Penaud was the Six Nations 2023 top tryscorer with five, and scored six at the World Cup - finishing second behind New Zealand's Will Jordan. He's racked up 35 tries in his career, and should add to that tally with Les Bleus likely to win most of their games.

Back Damian Penaud top tryscorer at 7/2 with bet365.
