POP paedophile Gary Glitter is resigned to dying in jail after losing a parole hearing.

The serial sex offender, 79, has told prison pals he fears he will not be released before his sentence ends in 2031.

And he has bleated about The Sun’s role in him being kept behind bars — after our investigation in March led to his recall to jail

A source said: “Glitter is really down and moaning about his situation.

"He has said, ‘I’m going to die in jail now’, and is resigned to it.

“He would be almost 87 by the time his sentence ends and knows the effect being inside can have on your health.”

Glitter — real name Paul Gadd — was freed last year halfway through a 16-year jail term for abusing three girls.

But within weeks, The Sun had found he was discussing the dark web at a bail hostel.

Our revelations meant he was recalled to HMP The Verne, Dorset, and two weeks ago the Parole Board blocked his release, saying he still posed a risk.

Our source said: “He still blames everyone else for his situation, rather than accepting it’s his fault.

“He particularly blames The Sun for him being where he is and has moaned that the paper has power over him.

“He can apply for parole again but is likely to be refused as he hasn’t changed.”
