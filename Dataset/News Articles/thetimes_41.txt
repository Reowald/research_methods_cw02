About half of the Gazan population is in Rafah after being told by Israel to flee there

Benny Gantz gives first timeline for ground offensive in refugee camp that is sheltering 1.5 million Palestinians

A member of Israel’s war cabinet has said the ground invasion on Rafah will begin by the Muslim holy month of Ramadan unless Hamas frees the hostages held in Gaza.

“If by Ramadan our hostages are not home — the fighting will continue to the Rafah area,” Benny Gantz, one of three war cabinet ministers, told a conference of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem.

The southern city of Rafah is sheltering some 1.5 million Palestinians, almost half the population and the last refuge for those who have fled the fighting across the Gaza Strip.

Gantz’s comments come amid growing concern that an assault on the city will have a devastating humanitarian impact on civilians who have run out of options on where to go next.
