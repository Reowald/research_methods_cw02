Watch as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex meet Invictus Games athletes and military veterans on Friday 16 February.

Harry and Meghan are in Vancouver as part of “One Year to Go” events for the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025.

They are expected to make remarks during their appearance on Friday.

Harry has already been seen attempting sit-skiing as he joined Invictus Games competitors training in Canada to mark a year until the global sporting event.

The couple met athletes at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort in British Columbia on Wednesday and they plan to visit more competitors at the host locations for the 2025 competition.

Harry founded the Paralympic-style sporting competition in 2014 for injured and sick military personnel and veterans to aid their recovery.

At the Games next year around 550 competitors from up to 25 nations will compete in indoor adaptive events like sitting volleyball, swimming and wheelchair basketball.

For the first time winter sports like alpine skiing, snowboarding and wheelchair curling will be on the schedule.
