An archive of more than 10,000 photographs capturing everyday life in Englandâ€™s north-west has been saved for the future, and is now being made available to the public in the Sankey Photography Archive. From 1885 to the 1970s thousands of photographs were taken by the Barrow-in-Furness-based father and son Edward and Raymond Sankey, who captured a wide range of subjects, including working-class women, childhood, royal visits, sport, working horses, motor vehicles, shop fronts, shipping and tourism in the Lake District. Their original glass plate negatives, postcards, albums and documentation have now been rescued, digitised and catalogued. The archive has been made possible with support from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Signal Film & Media
