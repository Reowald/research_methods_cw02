In the video, Davide approached the balcony blinds, opened them, stepped onto the balcony, and made a montage video capturing a feeling of 'bliss'.

He captioned the video: "You're one decision away from a totally different life."

Given the timing of the post following his recent breakup with Ekin-Su, it seemed as though he was alluding to the separation.

The Love Island winners announced their split just a few weeks ago.

Davide is currently holidaying in Dubai.

Earlier this week, Davide was surrounded by bikini-clad girls as he partied on a yacht in Dubai.

The Italian reality star appeared to be lapping up the attention as he posed for photos with scantily dressed ladies.

Ekin-Su recently said she made the decision to end their relationship in a lengthy statement on Instagram.

Ekin-Su said: "The last 18-months have been a rollercoaster of ups and downs, just like every relationship. Davide and I both wanted to make this work as we cared deeply for each other.

"Unfortunately I have recently made the decision to end our relationship and to go our separate ways..

"Breakups are never easy. For any couple. And we hope that our privacy will be respected. I enjoyed our time together and the memories we made."
