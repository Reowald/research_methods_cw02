The Huracan is a flawless combination of technology and performance - making for the drive of your life.

This iconic motor boasts streamlined finishes designed to cut through the air, which are paired perfectly with its 5.2L V10.

Lamborghini sells 2,600 Huracan a year, making the model the manufacturer's most commercially successful car ever.

The sleek two-door vehicle 'delivers all the feel and technology of a genuine race car in a road-legal model,' according to Lamborghini's website.

'Its extreme aerodynamics, track-honed handling dynamics, lightweight contents and the highest-performing V10 engine to date come together, ready to trigger all the emotions of the racetrack in your everyday life,' the site continues.

WHY CHOOSE DREAM CAR GIVEAWAYS?

Dream Car Giveaways started in 2018 and has since become one of the longest standing and most trusted competition companies.

Fast-forward six years and Dream Car Giveaways has seen over 10,000 winners from across the UK and Ireland walking away with everything from swanky motors to epic cash giveaway.
