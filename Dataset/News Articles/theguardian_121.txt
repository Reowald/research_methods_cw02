The Guardian now offers five different global editions – UK, Europe, US, Australia and International – each curated for the readers in those regions.

These editions showcase all the journalism produced by our reporters and offices across the world, with the five homepages tailored to show readers in each location the best selection of our reporting, features, sport, opinion and more.

Most readers are automatically directed to their local homepage based on their location.

To choose a different homepage to be your default, you can select any of the five editions from the menu bar on your mobile browser, the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the desktop website, and via the settings under the menu in the Guardian’s app for iOS and Android.
