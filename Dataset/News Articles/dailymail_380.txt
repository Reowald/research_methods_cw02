Shocking footage shows the moment a speeding driver smashed into six other cars on a high street in Birmingham.

The horrific crash took place on Soho Road, near West Bromwich Albion football club's home ground, on Sunday night.

The driver of a white sedan sped down the road before ploughing into at least six other vehicles in the line of traffic.

The impact appears to have forced at least one car to spin out and overtake the right-hand lane, blocking traffic in both directions.

It is unclear how many people were injured in the crash or what their current conditions are.
