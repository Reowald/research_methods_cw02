Baleen whales appear to have two nostrils, unlike dolphins, which may help them to zone in on their food sources

Scottish study suggests baleens use smell ‘in stereo’ to find zooplankton, which release the same chemical that also develops on ocean litter

Giant whales who use their nostrils to sniff out food could also be drawn to plastic pollution, a new Scottish study has revealed.

Researchers say baleens, the grouping that includes blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, may use their sense of smell to seek out tiny zooplankton, which emit a chemical into the ocean.

However, this same chemical is also released by plastic, leading scientists to fear the aquatic mammals could be susceptible to eating the harmful floating waste.

The marine experts behind the ground-breaking study, published in the journal Biology Letters, say further research is urgently needed to assess how whales find food and whether they could be more at risk
