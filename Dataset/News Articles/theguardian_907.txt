If you could write a manifesto, what would you include? With a general election on the horizon, what action should we demand from our next government in the fight against the climate crisis?

At this pivotal moment, putting the environment at the core of government policy is more critical than ever. How do we transition from fossil fuels and achieve net zero targets? From rewilding to transforming the farming and fishing industry, how do we protect our natural environment? And what does a green economy look like?

In this livestreamed and interactive event, we will explore ideas and innovations which could both transform our economy and safeguard the environment for future generations. The Guardian’s environment editor, Damian Carrington will be joined by Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift; Chaitanya Kumar, head of environment and green transition at The New Economics Foundation and Shaun Spiers, executive director of Green Alliance.
