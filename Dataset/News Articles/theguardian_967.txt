An overturned barge has been leaking oil into the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago, prompting authorities on the island nation to declare a state of emergency. Satellite imagery showed parts of the Trinidadian coast dyed black from the spill, and the leak began reaching nearby Venezuela and Grenada. Farley Augustine, chief secretary of Tobagoâ€™s House of Assembly, said: 'We need those responsible to come clean and we need those responsible to know that they have to pay for this mess, that they are culpable as part of this mess'
