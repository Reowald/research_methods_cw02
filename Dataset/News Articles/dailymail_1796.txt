Gemini 22 MAY-21 JUNE With a New Moon in your sign and a stunning Mars-Jupiter link, you’ll forget a long-term worry this week. Instead, you’ll focus on what really matters rather than give false life to things of no real importance. Make it your aim to be healthy and happy. CALL 0904 470 1163*

Cancer 22 JUNE-23 JULY You’ll make your mark on the world this week, a mark that will last for years. A particularly positive Mars-Jupiter union gives you the energy and confidence to put yourself forward and show those in authority you are special. This is no time to be modest! CALL 0904 470 1164*

Leo 24 JULY-23 AUG This week’s Mars-Jupiter aspect means voices will be raised and tempers lost but with the right attitude it will pass over your head. What you need most is a sense of humour that can laugh at life’s ups and downs. Strive to see the funny side of what happens. CALL 0904 470 1165*

Virgo 24 AUG-23 SEPT There’s no point in arguing with people who refuse to see sense, regardless of the facts. It may be tempting to show them up but why bother? In time they’ll recognise their stupidity but if they insist on doing it the hard way, let them. Don’t interfere. CALL 0904 470 1166*

Libra 24 SEPT-23 OCT You’ll be extremely energetic this week, and extremely stubborn with it. But be warned that cosmic forces in your opposite sign of Aries mean you won’t get it all your own way. Some of your opponents may be more stubborn than you. CALL 0904 470 1167*

Scorpio 24 OCT-22 NOV You’ll find it hard to be patient this week but you won’t get far if you lose your temper or accuse others of dragging their feet. Also, if you get annoyed you could do yourself physical or emotional harm. Your health is especially important at the moment. CALL 0904 470 1168*

Sagittarius 23 NOV-21 DEC A stunning Mars-Jupiter aspect in the most dynamic, romantic and creative area of your chart marks a breakthrough this week – one you’ll remember for years. Whatever your goal, this is the time to make it happen. Nothing and no one can stop you. CALL 0904 470 1169*

Capricorn 22 DEC-20 JAN Solicit the support of relatives this week or your plans won’t get far. It will help if you can persuade them that what you want for yourself will be good for them too. It will help even more if that happens to be true – this isn’t an invitation to tell lies. CALL 0904 470 1170*

Aquarius 21 JAN-19 FEB You’ll want to change your life this week, to get more out of it without putting so much in. You can start by not wasting time on irrelevant pursuits. Your social life, in particular, can be a big drain on your energy. Cut back on unnecessary commitments. CALL 0904 470 1171*

Pisces 20 FEB-20 MARCH You’ll be quick off the mark this week, especially if there’s a chance to make money.

Taurus 21 APRIL-21 MAY You’re paying far too much attention to other people instead of listening to your own heart. You do not need others’ help, you just need to turn your focus inward and follow your own inner voice. It knows the answers to even your most difficult questions. CALL 0904 470 1162*
