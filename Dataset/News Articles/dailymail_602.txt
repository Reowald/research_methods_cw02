For struggling dog owners anguishing over having to give up their pets, a charity with a system akin to online dating could ease their worries.

PetRehomer links owners who can no longer care for their animals with prospective adopters online.

New owners are vetted to ensure they are suitable before details are passed to the original owner, who then selects their pet's new pad.

The charity does a home check before a potential adopter meets the animal. Afterwards, the former owners can stay in touch with their pets.

In its first year, PetRehomer has already facilitated the adoption of 450 dogs, as well as a number of cats and rabbits. Dogs with a history of biting and banned breeds are not accepted by the charity.

Applications are judged on a case-by-case basis and there are no strict rules, unlike many rescue centres which refuse to allow adoptions by anyone over the age of 80.

Most people looking to re-home pets cite 'a change of circumstances' as the main reason, together with the cost of living crisis.

Founder Colleen Long, 56, describes the charity as 'Rightmove for pets'.

She said: 'Sometimes, re-homing a pet is the best thing for all concerned. But to pass animals to people who might not be suitable is unforgivable. We provide a safe alternative.'
