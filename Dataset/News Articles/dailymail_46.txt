Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has claimed he intended to score his second goal in the win 2-1 win over Luton.

The Danish striker extended his goal-scoring run to six matches with a brace at Kenilworth Road.

He opened the scoring against Rob Edwards' side after just 37 seconds, rounding Hatters goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski before guiding the ball into an empty net.

Hojlund's second goal came with more fortune after the ball struck his shoulder on it's way to the back of the net following a shot by Alejandro Garnacho.

'At the moment I have a lot of confidence so it goes in. I never doubted myself but of course you can be a bit down when you're not scoring. I always believe in myself, I knew it was just a matter of time.

'I always try to do my best. When we're in front of the goal I try to do the extra pass to win the game.

'I play for one of the biggest clubs in the world, so it's quality players I play and train with. I just want to keep getting even better.'

The win over Luton has put United three points behind fifth-placed Tottenham and five adrift of Aston Villa in fourth.

Hojlund has set his sight on a top-four finish and a deep run in the FA Cup, with the Red Devils set to visit Nottingham Forest in the fifth round later this month.

He added: 'This was massive today. Closing an even closer gap to Spurs. We need to keep pushing, it's our target to get Champions League football and go far in the FA Cup as well.'

United will seek to continue their impressive form next weekend when Fulham visit Old Trafford.
