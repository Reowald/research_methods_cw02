The Mini has always been one of the ultimate city cars. The original, conceived by Sir Alec Issigonis in 1959, was a triumph of design. A car that can seat four with decent-ish room for luggage, with one of the tiniest footprints on the road. The British vehicle came along when almost everything emerging from these islands was deemed cool and fashionable, and fitted right in as the accessory of choice for celebrities of the day. Twiggy and the Beatles were being photographed draped over their cars and the Mini was a hit overseas as well: Steve McQueen had one in his collection and even the acutely discerning Enzo Ferrari drove one. High praise indeed.

You can buy the car in hatch, Countryman, convertible … we’ve even had a coupé, roadster and Paceman. And to keep up with the times, there is, of course, the Mini Electric. It first broke cover in 2020 and capitalised on the electric technology that its parent company BMW had developed with other BEV vehicles, notably the successful and impressive i3.
