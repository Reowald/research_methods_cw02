After her swim, she clinked glasses filled with Aperol Spritz towards the camera for a stunning selfie.

Amanda once said that she feels even more fabulous as she gets older and doesn't want to age quietly. Just before turning 50, she joked: "I love that people are still talking about my tired old breasts and I'm nearly 50. Age is totally irrelevant, thanks to people like J.Lo a hot woman who dresses for how she feels."

Amanda also shared some tips on how she stays fit. She runs three times a week and does a plank for one minute every day. She said: "As long as I feel like I want to, I will always wear a bikini, regardless of anybody else's thoughts on the subject. If you feel happy and body-confident, wear the bikini. It's just madness. You will never find me in a bathing suit!"
