Aldi has urgently recalled one of its pasta dishes because it contains an undeclared ingredient which could pose as an allergy risk.

The Carlos Takeaway Meat Feast Pasta Bake has been recalled by the discount retailer as the product contains mustard.

This is not mentioned on the label and could be deemed a possible health risk.

It comes as Aldi has embarked on a Â£550 million expansion drive in a bid to claw back shoppers after losing out to its rivals in January this year.

The discount retailer aims to eventually open 500 new stores and create over 1,500 new jobs across the country, as well as upgrading its existing stores.

Aldi has urged shoppers who have bought the product and have an allergy to mustard to not eat it and instead return it to the store for a refund.
