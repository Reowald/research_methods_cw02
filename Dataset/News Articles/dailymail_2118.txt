Another Bridgetown classic is Enterprise Beach - known locally as Miami Beach, it's one of the most popular strips of sand on the island.

Surfing fans should wave hello to the Soup Bowl in St Joseph on the Atlantic shore - one of surfer Kelly Slater's favourite spots. The waves are incredible and there are incredible rocks to marvel at, too.

On the south-east coast is Silver Sands Beach, so named because - yes - the sand is almost silver. Its Insta-worthy dunes add to the allure.
