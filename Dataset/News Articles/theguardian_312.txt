Fort Augustus to Invermoriston 13 km/8 miles



After a hearty breakfast, stretch your legs as you climb through a forest of birch and pine, beside a stream and uphill to a forest track. You should get some dramatic views of Loch Ness at intervals through the woods. Walk through the village of Invermoriston with its little bridge built by Thomas Telford. The Invermoriston Hotel is a great place to eat and has several types of malt whisky. They also have great beer from The Skye Brewery. There are nice leafy walks down by the river. Note our route describes the low level option for this leg. Accommodation: Darroch View is a guesthouse that was purpose built in 1995 to provide a family home and bed & breakfast accommodation. Each bedroom is well-furnished and has a spacious ensuite. You can relax in the evening by the open fire in the lounge, while the breakfast room enjoys great views of Sron Na Muic.
