Paedo pop star Gary Glitter has told pals he is resigned to dying in jail after he lost his latest parole hearing.

The 79-year-old former pop star and serial sex offender has told fellow inmates that he now believes he will not see freedom before his sentence ends in 2031.

Gary Glitter - real name Paul Gadd - was freed last year, halfway through his 16-year prison sentence for abusing three girls. But he was returned to HMP The Verne, Dorset, after he was reportedly caught discussing the dark web at a bail hostel. He went before the Parole Board two weeks ago but his release was blocked after they found he still posed a risk.

An unnamed source from inside the jail reportedly said that Glitter was “moaning” that he would die behind bars after his latest setback.

“Glitter is really down and moaning about his situation,” the source told the Sun. “He has said, ‘I’m going to die in jail now’, and is resigned to it. He would be almost 87 by the time his sentence ends and knows the effect being inside can have on your health.”

The former popstar is unwilling to take any of the blame however, according to the source, who said: “He still blames everyone else for his situation, rather than accepting it’s his fault.”

The anonymous informant added: “He can apply for parole again but is likely to be refused as he hasn’t changed.”
