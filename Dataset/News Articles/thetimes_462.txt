Nearly two thirds of popular swimming spots on English rivers have been found to have unsafe levels of bacteria.

While hundreds of beaches are designated bathing waters, there are just three such areas on rivers, including sections of Wolvercote Mill Stream, near Oxford, the Wharfe in Yorkshire and the Deben in Suffolk. Designation denotes regular water quality testing by officials between May and September.

It leaves popular sites used for activities from wild swimming to paddleboarding largely unmonitored.

The charity Surfers Against Sewage sent “citizen scientists” to take samples at 40 sites on 11 rivers including the Thames, Dart, Itchen, Stour and Dee. They tested for E. coli and intestinal Enterococci levels, both indicators of faeces being present.

The group found that 24 sites would be ranked poor for high bacteria levels, the worst on the Environment Agency’s four-level classification system for bathing waters.
