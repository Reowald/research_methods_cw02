Annie Nightingale was described as an inspiration and trailblazer for other female DJs

Radio 1’s first female DJ, who has died aged 83, was also the original rave granny, writes Will Hodgkinson

Annie Nightingale held the record for being the world’s longest-serving female radio presenter, joining BBC Radio 1 in 1970 and never leaving. She broke into what was then a boys’ club, remaining, remarkably, the only female DJ at Radio 1 until 1982.

But Nightingale held another honour: being the original rave granny. Perhaps because her teenage years coincided with the first flush of pop culture, perhaps because she simply knew how to have a good time, Nightingale was legendary not just for her celebration of new music in its myriad forms, but for her energy, humour and unbridled hedonism.
