You may well have forgotten about Julian Assange. It’s been more than 11 years since he disappeared from public view – first into the claustrophobic seclusion of the Ecuadorian embassy and then, nearly seven years later, to the maximum security Belmarsh prison. Out of sight, out of mind.

All that is about to change as he makes a last-ditch attempt in London’s High Court to avoid being extradited to America – and the strong likelihood of once more vanishing – this time into a state penitentiary for a very long time.

Why should we care?
