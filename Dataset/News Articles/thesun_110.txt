In the living room, a large corner sofa sits at the back of the room and an enormous TV hangs from the wall.

Behind the TV, the walls are decorated with fashionable wood panels and a giant three legged lamp rests in the corner of the room .

Dotted around the house are adorable potted plants and lots of photo frames, giving the place a very cosy and homely feel.

I thought Iâ€™d bought a bog standard house but then found a secret that not even the previous tenants knew about

Council tenants are allowed to make alterations and renovations to their homes.

However, they must make sure that any work conforms to building regulations and planning permission.

Council houses are provided by local authorities to those in need.

They are often cheaper than renting private housing and can also offer greater security from eviction.

Council houses are allocated to prospective tenants via a points based system, with those in greater need given homes first.

The council will contact you about an available property when you are high enough up the waiting list.

More than one million people are currently waiting for social housing in the UK.
