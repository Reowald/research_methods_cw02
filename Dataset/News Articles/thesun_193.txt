Amanda took to her Instagram stories to show fans her outfits.

She looked stunning in an orange bikini that showed off her toned abs and cleavage.

Amanda also took to an infinity pool to pose in a white swimsuit featuring a zippered front.

Her most daring look was one where she sat on top of a cave completely in the nude.

The Heart Radio host captioned the post: "Birthday suit…53."

Her celeb pals were quick to comment with Alan Carr writing: "Phwooarrr!!! I love you! Happy Birthday!"

Strictly judge Oti Mabuse commented: "Happy happy birthday gorgeous."

Amanda's two daughters, Lexi, 18, and Hollie, 12, joined her on the holiday.

Amanda has spoken repeatedly in the past about how she only feels hotter as she gets older and refuses to cover up.

She previously stated: “I don’t see the point in growing old gracefully."

The star is currently a judge on Britain's Got Talent with Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon, and Bruno Tonioli.
