Thinking of a move down under?

Compare My Move has put together a guide to the pros and cons of moving to Australia, which includes the similarities and differences between UK and Australian life, the cost of moving and living in Australia - and the salary differences.

If you're considering trading grey clouds for some Aussie sun, you're not alone. Compare My Move says it's the most popular country for Brits to migrate to, with approximately 1.2million Brits moving annually.

The company - which allows users to compare quotes from a network of verified removal companies - claims Australia has a more relaxed work-life balance, higher wages and good investment opportunities. Healthcare and education are also of a top standard and there are plenty of job opportunities for expats.

HOW TO MAKE THE MOVE

Given that Australia is located across the globe from the UK - 9,443 miles away - the company says you can expect international removal costs to be significantly higher than moving to other countries.

Compare My Move research shows that shipping to Australia from the UK will cost an average of £5,258, based on a 40ft container, which is equivalent to a three-bedroom-house worth of belongings. If you require the use of additional services, such as packing, this will cost around £250.

The total cost of international removals will vary based on factors such as the type of shipping used, the weight and number of items, and the distance travelled.

While this price might seem expensive, there are plenty of perks once you're there.

LIFE DOWN UNDER

Compare My Move says working in Australia is 'far better' than in the UK. Salaries are higher, workplaces are more relaxed, and there is a good amount of job availability.

The average wage in Australia is $90,800AUD (£48,000), according to Time Doctor. This wage is not far off double the UK average of around £28,000, with wages in the state of Western Australia 50 per cent higher.

Workplaces and jobs in Australia aren’t too dissimilar to the UK, Compare My Move says. And if you currently have a specific profession, you can likely continue in a similar role when moving.

The moving company adds that Australia has a skill shortage in certain professions, including childcare, construction, programming, carers and doctors. As a result, it claims, British citizens will likely find employment quickly and easily, especially if they can fill these roles.

PROPERTY PRICES

Property prices are also cheaper in Australia, Compare My Move reveals. The average price per square metre for a property in an Australian city is $11,107.41 (£5,891.87). In the UK, the price is around £8,275.97 per square metre.

The company adds, however, that properties outside of Australian city centres cost $8,283.10 (£4,393.73) per square metre. In the UK, these properties cost £3,291.35 per square metre.

On average, buying a house in an Australian city is £2,384.10 cheaper than buying a house in a UK city. If you’re set on living in a city in Australia, Sydney and Melbourne are the most expensive areas to live in, whereas Adelaide, Cairns and Perth are more affordable.

However, while property prices in Australia are cheaper on the whole, rent prices down under are higher. Compare My Move reveals a one-bedroom home in Australia costs $2,284.71 (£1,207.67) per month to rent compared to £906.99 in the UK. A three-bedroom house will cost around $3,738.52 (£1976.13) in Australia as opposed to an average of £1,607.79 per month in the UK.

The overall cost of living in Australia is also 13 per cent more expensive when compared to the UK, according to the moving company. While some living expenses are cheaper, such as utility bills, most things are more expensive.

Although the cost of living is higher in Australia, Compare My Move notes that the higher wages help to offset the increased costs.
