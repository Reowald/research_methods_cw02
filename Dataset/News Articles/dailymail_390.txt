Prince William was beaming last night as he headed backstage to meet the stars of this year's glitzy BAFTAs in London.

The Prince of Wales, 42, put on a cheerful display as he arrived at the 77th annual awards solo while his wife Kate continues to recover at their family home following her abdominal surgery.

William, who wore his signature navy velour suit jacket and dickie bow, was heard apologising for the Princess of Wales absence, telling organisers 'I am sorry Catherine's not here, she does love the BAFTAs'.

The father-of-three, who has been focusing on his family following his wife's medical procedure and his father King Charles' shock cancer diagnosis, added that he had not watched as many films as usual admitting he's had 'other things on his mind'

Earlier on in the evening, the heir took photos with members of the public who lined the red carpet outside the Royal Festival Hall admitting to shocked film fanatics that he still has not watched Box Office sensation Barbie.

Backstage, after Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer bagged seven awards, the Prince was seen shaking hands with Bridgerton star Phoebe Dynevor, American star Ayo Edebiri and Australian actress Sophie Wilde, amongst others.

He also greeted Earth Mama director Savannah Leaf, producer Medb Riodan and producers Shirley O'Connor backstage, who won the BAFTA for debut British writer, director or producer.

After all the gongs had been awarded, William met with some of the nominees of the rising star award - won by the star of coming-of-age film How To Have Sex, Mia McKenna-Bruce.

He told them: 'The category was so strong, all of you, it was like who is going to pull this off? It was incredible. It was very close between all of you.'

He congratulated Ms McKenna-Bruce and admitted he had not watched her film yet, but said: 'It looked like you had a lot of fun the whole way through.'

Upon her recommendation to watch it, William said: 'I've got a lot of films to catch up on.

'Normally I get quite ahead of the awards ceremony, I get to see quite a few of them. I haven't managed to get that many through.'

He added that he now has a list of films to watch.

William reiterated the strength of the competition when speaking to the director and two producers of Earth Mama - which won outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.

He told the three women: 'The competition in all the categories were so strong this year.'

'And also what's so lovely is there was diversity in so many areas,' the Prince added.

Film fanatics who had lined-up outside the Royal Festival Hall were pleased to here the Prince had watched Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer but were shocked to find out he was yet to watch Greta Gerwig's Barbie, starring Margot Robbie.

'I haven't seen Barbie yet,' the Prince admitted, with excited fans telling him 'You need to see it.'

William said that he 'hopes to catch up' and will watch the films alongside his recovering wife.

After arriving, the Prince took a seat next to Hollywood royalty Cate Blanchett as they prepared to watch the ceremony presented this year by David Tennant.

He sat in the front row of the 2,400 auditorium at the Royal Festival Hall.

A host of A-listers descended on London's South Bank this evening with Margot Robbie, Emma Stone, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh amongst those making a dazzling appearance.

Tonight's awards marks the first high-profile royal engagement Prince William has made since his wife's major operation and father's diagnosis.

Earlier this month he gave a speech at a London charity engagement raising funds for London's Air Ambulance Charity's new fleet of helicopters earlier this month.

It was thought he might skip the ceremony, which he usually appears arm in arm with Kate, but the Prince was keen to continue with his duties and represent the Royal Family at the prestigious event.

Kate had surgery on January 16 at the London clinic and has since returned to Adelaide Cottage in Windsor to be with her three children.

Tonight's ceremony marks the 77th annual award, with Nolan's atomic bomb biopic expected to be a big winner after receiving 13 nominations.

Prince William has been a patron for 14 years with his wife first attending the event with her husband in 2017.

At last years event, Kate Middleton opted for an Alexander McQueen one shoulder gown for the occasion, which she first wore to the event in 2019.

For his outfit, William kept things classic and simple in a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo jacket.
