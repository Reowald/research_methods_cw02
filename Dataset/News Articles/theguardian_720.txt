Russia has said it has taken full control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, its biggest gain since capturing Bakhmut last May, after a retreat by Ukrainian troops.

Russian troops launched multiple attacks further west from Avdiivka in a bid for more battlefield gains, a Ukrainian army spokesperson said. Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from the city in the industrial Donbas region to avoid encirclement.

Some Ukrainian troops were reportedly holed up in a vast Soviet-era coke plant, one of Europeâ€™s biggest, Russia said. However, on Sunday the Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken full control of the plant. The Guardian was unable to verify these reports
