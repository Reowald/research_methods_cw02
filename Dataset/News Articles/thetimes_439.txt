Ian Doble’s new house satisfies twin passions. He’s always loved the sea and wanted to be near it — he’s made his living running a company that lays undersea cables across the Atlantic. Another passion is gardening, particularly with exotic plants that don’t normally grow in Britain. In his former house, in Hampshire, he’d spend much of the winter pottering in his greenhouse, but it meant spending hours away from his wife, Helen.

Their new house offers the best of both worlds: it’s perched above a spectacular beach on the Gower peninsula, outside Swansea, where he and Helen can hear the sea in bed at night. And it has an indoor garden where he can potter in all weathers, and Helen can chat to him
