JUDE THE MATURE Migrant used comparison to mature-looking England star Jude Bellingham to win right to stay in UK

A MIGRANT used a comparison to mature-looking footie prodigy Jude Bellingham to win the right to stay in the UK.

The asylum-seeker was thought to be 22 when he arrived in the UK in 2022 but has convinced a tribunal judge he was under 18.

His football coach compared him to Real Madrid star Bellingham, now 20, pointing out he played for Birmingham at 16.

The coach insisted he looked young, telling the tribunal: “People came in different sizes and that size was not age-related.”

It led the judge to rule he was born in 2005, in effect, preventing his deportation.

The lad fled Sudan in 2020, arriving in the back of a lorry at Dover two years ago.

Officials wrote: “He had deep smile lines, seen in older people. Stubble hair was observed.

"His hairline appeared to be receding.”

He settled in London, where he joined a football team.

The Upper Tribunal ruling said: “The coach observed Jude Bellingham had been playing in the top adult league at 17.”

Despite the ruling, the Home Office will not pay damages.

Former minister Mark Francois said: “The Home Office should be making greater use of advances in medical technology.”

Government sources said it had a robust system for determining migrants’ ages.
