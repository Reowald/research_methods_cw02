Jurgen Klopp said Saturday's win over Brentford ‘came at a cost’ as Liverpool lost Diogo Jota, Curtis Jones and Darwin Nunez to injuries – a week before the Carabao Cup final with Chelsea.

All three will need to be assessed to see if they can be fit for that Wembley Stadium showdown.

Jones was seen boarding the Liverpool team bus wearing a protective boot with Klopp afterwards admitting that the injury to Jota looked ‘worse’ while Nunez was substituted at half-time because he felt 'something'.

Liverpool were already missing Alisson, Trent Alexander- Arnold, Dominik Szoboszlai, Joel Matip, Thiago and more for Saturday's trip to London.

They added three points to their Premier League total – with the return of Mohamed Salah a big boost – but also three problems ahead of facing Chelsea.

‘It came at a cost,’ Klopp said. ‘But we have to see how much it cost. Curtis got a knock above the ankle. The fact that Curtis could not play on tells you that it must be something.

‘Diogo looks worse. We have to see there. Darwin, we took off because he said he feels something a little.

'That’s not great. We can talk about that part of the game which is really not good. It was a very good game in strange circumstances but we are still happy with the result.’
