Right now, you can save 25 per cent on the top-rated design in Simba’s sale. “A layer of memory foam moulds to your body, gently cradling you, while a layer of springs gives more considered support, which saw us wake without any aches or pains,” our tester said.

An ideal choice year-round, there’s a layer of wool under the surface of the mattress, which has natural temperature-regulating and hypoallergenic properties, meaning our tester didn’t overheat. They added that, with its seven-layer design, it’s one of the more luxurious mattresses you can buy – meaning you don’t want to miss out while it’s on sale. The discount is applied automatically at the checkout, and you’ll also get a free mattress protector.

Casper hybrid mattress, super king: Was £1,250, now £1,000, Mattressonline.co.uk

(Casper)

In our previous guide to the best mattresses, our writer described this one as “combining the brand’s legendary foams with a base layer of springs, you get instant sumptuousness, from the moulding of the four foam layers around your body, coupled with added bounce and airflow, thanks to the pocket coil springs.”

The writer was impressed before she’d even got it out of its vacuum pack: “How can those springs be so compressible? Nearly five years of research, is the answer from Casper. But that was nothing compared to our excitement over the immediate comfort.” With £250 off and such a rave review, this really is a no-brainer.
