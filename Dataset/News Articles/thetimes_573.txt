A woman takes part in a pro-Brexit rally, but Goldman Sachs analysts say the move has cost the UK

Britain has “significantly underperformed” compared with the European Union and the United States since the vote to leave in June 2016, the bank claims

Britain’s economy is 5 per cent smaller than it would have been if the country had chosen to stay in the European Union, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs.

A sharp hit to UK goods trade, weaker business investment and a steep increase in non-EU migrants coming to Britain, who study rather than work, have held back economic growth.

Analysts at the American investment bank said that “the UK has significantly underperformed other advanced economies since the 2016 EU referendum, with lower growth and higher inflation”. It estimated that since 2016, consumer prices had leapt by 31 per cent in Britain. In the United States and the eurozone they had increased by 27 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, it said.
