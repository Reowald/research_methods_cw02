Pirates of the Caribbean star Kevin McNally has been arrested over domestic violence claims and has been released on bail set at £40,000.

Shortly before the 67-year-old actor was due to attend the world's biggest Dr Who fan convention in Los Angeles, he was detained by the police.

McNally, who is married to actress Phyllis Logan, played Joshamee Gibbs in the Pirates of the Caribbean series - first mate to Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.

He has since been released on bail and is due in court next month, The Sun reported.

The newspaper reported that his wife denied knowing about his arrest.

His wife, Downton Abbey actress Phyllis Logan, denied knowledge of the arrest

McNally, who shares a son with his actress wife, also appeared in Downton Abbey alongside his spouse, who played housekeeper Mrs Hughes.

He was arrested early on Friday morning before he was expected at the 'Gallifrey One' fan convention in Los Angeles the next day.

Organisers told the disappointed fans he would not be there for personal reasons.

But LA police told The Sun that the actor was being held on suspicion of inflicting an injury that caused a traumatic condition on a victim who was his current or former spouse, cohabitant, or child's parent.

In 2021, he defended Depp, 60, when he was accused of beating up ex-girlfriend Amber Heard.

He said at the time: 'I've never seen a hint of a dark side to him.

'I see a great humanitarian and a beautiful human being. I don't see any impediment for him coming back and playing Jack Sparrow,' The Sun reported.

MailOnline has contacted McNally's representatives for comment.
