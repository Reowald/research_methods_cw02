But according to a person writing on Reddit, the little-known setting is great whenever the Amazon Fire TV Stick starts to get a little "fussy".

So if yours has become laggy and slow, it might be worth a shot.

Reddit user OgniDee recommends carrying out this hack every month for an instant refresh.

"I realize too, I just need to restart the whole thing maybe once a month when it gets "fussy"," they explained.

The setting in question is the restart button.

It's not to be confused with the "reset" option that clears your Amazon Fire TV Stick out completely of all apps and files.

Restart is essentially a reboot, so everything on the device stays put.

"I normally just send it to sleep when i'm done watching," OgniDee continued.

"But I've found that every so often it starts to get slow and hangy, so I go to "My Firestick" in the Settings and do a restart.

"Seems to help it run smoother. Restarting wont delete any APK's or settings like a Factory Reset would.

Fellow Reddit user kresbok responded, saying it's an "Awesome tip".

"Thanks a lot for sharing this!" they said.

"I did see that option on the menu but I did not known for what was for."
