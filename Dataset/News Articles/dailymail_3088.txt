Vauxhall is offering a year's free EV charging credit at Tesco stores for buyers of its new electric vehicles.

The carmaker says its supermarket partnership — using PodPoint chargers — will provide drivers with access to charge points across 619 stores.

It comes as part of Vauxhall's innovative 'Electric Streets of Britain' (electricstreets.co.uk) initiative.

This is designed to increase accessible charging to support the 40 per cent of UK households without a driveway as the slow roll-out of charging points is seen as a brake on sales.

It also coincides with Vauxhall and other carmakers introducing new discounts and finance deals for private buyers on sluggish-selling EVs.

Vauxhall noted: 'With 22 million visitors per month and over 1 million charging sessions, Tesco stores are found within a 10-minute drive for over 70 per cent of the UK population, allowing greater ease and convenience for EV drivers across the country.'

Vauxhall managing director James Taylor said: 'As electric vehicle sales continue to grow, access to practical charging continues to be a hot topic to ensure the UK can continue along its electrification journey, whether at home, on-street or at a required destination.'

Tesco supermarket forecourts have with a mix of 7kW, 22kW, 50kW and 75kW charging stations.
