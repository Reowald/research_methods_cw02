The plans are yet another sign William is getting on with work despite the King’s cancer diagnosis as it emerged he had ruled out Harry’s return to the royal fold

The Prince of Wales is to build a £3million social housing project on his land to help end homelessness.

William has overseen plans to construct 24 homes in Cornwall to be ready next year. Working with charity St Petrocs, they will provide high-quality accommodation in an area with one of the UK’s most acute homelessness problems.

The plans are yet another sign William is getting on with work despite the King’s cancer diagnosis as it emerged he had ruled out Harry’s return to the royal fold. William believes Harry and Meghan “cannot be trusted”, it is understood.

A source said: “His main focus is on his father’s health, his family and what is best for the monarchy. There is a zero per cent chance Harry is coming back in any capacity.” Yesterday it emerged William would oversee the construction of f four-bedroom houses and one-bedroom flats.

It is understood the homes will be low-carbon and have slate roofs, granite lintels, solar panels and heat pumps.

William wants shrubs and flowers to be planted to encourage biodiversity. The 130,000 acres from Cornwall to Kent were valued at £1billion. It could pave the way for him to oversee more projects on the land he owns as Duke of Cornwall, a title he inherited from his father.

Estate director Ben Murphy said: “As one of his key priorities, Prince William asked us to address the homelessness challenge within Cornwall and other areas where the estate resides. We are excited to reveal plans for this innovative housing project to help break the cycle of homelessness in Newquay.”

St Petrocs’ chief executive Henry Meacock said:“This partnership is an important step in achieving our shared goal of ending homelessness.”
