Martin Lewis gave his honest opinion after a viewer told him that his credit score had dropped.

Speaking on Tuesday's (30 January) Martin Lewis Money Show Live, the MoneySavingExpert heard from a man who said his credit score dropped by "30 or more points" from his 100 per cent score after changing his phone Sim contract to Â£10 a month.

In response, Lewis told the viewer: "I don't care".

Clarifying his comments, he added: "That's not me being flippant... You shouldn't care either for the simple reason that your credit score doesn't really mean anything."
