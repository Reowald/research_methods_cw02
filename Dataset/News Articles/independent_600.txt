Watch the moment SpaceX launched a secretive US government plane into orbit.

The X-37B craft was launched from Nasaâ€™s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday 28 December.

Few details have been revealed about the mission, but like previous ones, the reusable plane resembling a mini space shuttle carried classified experiments.

There is no one on board.

The launch marked the seventh flight of an X-37B, which has logged more than 10 years in orbit since its debut in 2010.

According to AP, this US military secretive mission is expected to last at least a couple of years.
