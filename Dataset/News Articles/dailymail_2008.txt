The English actress and director, 46, collected the prestigious award from producer David Heyman, who she worked with on Fantastic Beasts.

Samantha was emotional as she accepted the fellowship on Sunday at the ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall, and hailed the win as 'nothing short of a miracle'.

'Seeing poverty and people like me on the screen, I recognised myself - representation matters,' Samantha said.

'I used to say when I was a kid of many children's homes, I used to say, 'It'd be great, why don't I just go to some fancy boarding school? At least then I get an education'. But that wasn't on the cards.'

She added: 'To those kids in care, don't allow the system to drag you down because it can and it will.'

Oppenheimer won Best Film as well as sweeping the board in the major categories at the BAFTA Film Awards at The Royal Festival Hall on Sunday.

He triumphed against Bradley Cooper for Maestro, Colman Domingo for Rustin, Paul Giamatti for The Holdovers, Barry Keoghan for Saltburn and Teo Yoo for Past Lives.

Accepting the trophy he said: 'Oh boy, holy moly, thank you very, very much BAFTA.'

Oppenheimer swept up in the big name categories, but it was closely followed by the surreal black comedy Poor Things.

It marked five awards for the film, as Emma Stone collected the Best Actress gong for her turn as Bella Baxter.

Accepting her award, she said: 'Since we're in London, I want to start by thanking dialect coach. She praised him for not laughing at her when he taught her how to say 'water'.

'I really wanted to thank my mum, because she's the best person I know. Without her none of this would exist, including my life, so thank you for that Mum.'

American actress Stone said she was 'in awe' of all of the team behind the comedy, where she plays the part of a woman who is reanimated and implanted with the brain of a baby.

She paid tribute to the writers for coming up with the line 'I must go punch that baby' in a memorable dinner scene, and also hailed director Yorgos Lanthimos for 'our friendship and the gift of Bella'.

Also thanking her mother, Stone said: 'She kind of made me believe this crazy idea that I can do something like this.'

Meanwhile, Da'Vine Joy Randolph crowned victorious in the Best Supporting Actress category for her part in The Holdovers as she continues her march to Oscars glory.

Randolph took to the stage and told Chiwetel Ejiofor, who was presenting the award, 'you are so handsome' - prompting laughter from the audience.

On a more serious note, she said: 'Thank you for trusting me with this beautiful character.

Becoming emotional, she said being able to 'wear this beautiful gown, standing on the stage in London, is not a responsibility I take lightly'.

The night kicked off with French legal drama Anatomy Of A Fall winning the Original Screenplay award after premiering in Cannes back in May.

Collecting the award, co-writer and director Justine Triet, said: 'The last time I I was in London, a woman said to me: 'After I saw your movie I called my ex and told him to see it to understand why I dumped him.'
