Yet so few know its secrets and hidden gems.

Author Christopher Winn lifts the veil in fascinating book I Never Knew That About London (Ebury).

The publisher says: '[The book] unearths the hidden gems of legends, firsts, inventions, adventures and birthplaces that shape the city's compelling, and at times, turbulent past.'

LONDON BRIDGE – A FORMER WONDER OF THE WORLD

The first London Bridge was built around AD 52 by the invading Roman army of Emperor Claudius, somewhere near the site of the present bridge (above)

'London Bridge is where London began,' explains Winn. 'The first bridge was built around AD 52 by the invading Roman army of Emperor Claudius, somewhere near the site of the present bridge.

'The first stone bridge was begun in 1176, in the reign of Henry II. When it was finished in 1209 it was 20ft (6m) wide, 900ft (274m) long and had 20 arches. This bridge became one of the wonders of the world and was to last 600 years.

'By the 15th century, buildings lined the whole length of the bridge, some of them seven or eight storeys high and touching at the top, making the bridge into a tunnel.

'In 1722 the Lord Mayor ordered that bridge traffic should keep to the left, the first time the rule had officially been made compulsory in Britain.'

Winn explains that in the 1960s, a replacement bridge built in 1831 was bought by Robert McCulloch from Arizona for $2,460,000. He had it shipped over to Lake Havasu City on the Colorado River. It was recognised by The Guinness Book of Records as 'the largest antique ever sold', Winn notes.

RICHARD THE LIONHEART'S BURIED HEART
