Following research finding that a third of UK teenagers believe the climate crisis is “exaggerated” and a backlash against feminism among young men, we want to learn more about the spread of misinformation and divisive narratives among young people in the UK.

In the US, a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that teenagers were significantly more likely to believe online conspiracy theories than older generations, likely underscoring the impact of social media.

We would like to hear from young people (18 and over) in the UK about what they think is behind this. What are the main narratives people around you discuss?

How is this affecting your relationships with your peers in real life? Are your friend groups divided or united on these issues? Is there a gendered aspect to it or not, in your experience?

Where are they coming from and what do you think is behind it – social media or something else? Do you agree or disagree with this worldview?

We also want to hear from parents, teachers and others working with young people. Do you think there have been recent triggers, or part of long-term trends? What impact is it having? Are you concerned?
