WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - Sheffield United defender Mason Holgate has joined some unwanted company after committing one of the worst fouls Premier League fans have witnessed

Mason Holgate's short-term stay at Sheffield United may be remembered for all the wrong reasons.

The Blades took another worrying turn towards relegation on Sunday after suffering a 5-0 evisceration at home to Brighton. And Holgate - on loan from Everton - lasted just nine minutes before he was sent off for one of the worst challenges witnessed in recent Premier League history.

In fact, the 27-year-old's knee-high scissor attempt was put up there with the worst ever witnessed in England's top flight by some fans. That can only mean one thing as Daily Star Sport looks back through the Premier League chronicles to examine which challenges can hold a candle to Holgate's hellish entry.
