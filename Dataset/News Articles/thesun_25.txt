The Rwanda Bill will return to the House of Lords today but faces an onslaught

RWANDA VOW Rwanda flights will take off before general election, says migration minister

DEPORTATION flights to Rwanda will take off before the general election, the illegal migration minister has declared.

The pledge was made by Michael Tomlinson — but he stressed Parliament must vote for the bill and ratify the treaty underpinning the policy.

He insisted it was a “moral imperative” to deter the boats and stop the smuggling gangs.

Asked if he was guaranteeing flights before the next election, he told Sky News: “Yes. We need to get through the bill first.

"We need to get the treaty ratified and then the planes will take off.”

He stressed he wanted flights to v to happen “as soon as possible” so that the deterrent effect “will kick in”.

PM Rishi Sunak has accepted a £1,000 bet with TalkTV’s Piers Morgan over the success of the Rwanda plan before the election — but has not made any guarantees.

The Rwanda Bill - introduced as an attempt to revive the policy after the Supreme Court ruled it unlawful - will return to the House of Lords today but faces an onslaught.

Peers who oppose the plan are set to delay the Government’s plans, after tabling a string of wrecking amendments to strip out measures they say breach international law.
