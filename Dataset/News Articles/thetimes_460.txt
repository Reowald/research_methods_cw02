Britain, I’m afraid, must face the humiliating reality that not only is every river in England polluted but also the UK’s entire population of Atlantic salmon has been placed on the endangered species list.

Our magnificent salmon has joined the black rhino, mountain gorilla and tiger — animals whose futures are threatened by the very existence of man. It’s no longer some fuzzy issue of indifference perpetrated in a distant, misty foreign land. It is happening right here, today, in our own backyard. As a nation we are committing ecocide.
