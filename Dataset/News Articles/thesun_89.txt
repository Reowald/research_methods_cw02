FORMER Love Island star Arabella Chi looks like a breath of fresh hair as she plays with her long locks.

The model, dumped by Manchester City’s Ruben Dias last month, is looking for love in the All Stars version of the show.

At first she struggled to find a connection on the dating show, which ends tonight.

But she left the series with a new fella — WWE wrestler Adam Maxted.

Arabella, 32, said: “At times I thought in the villa, how am I being as unlucky in love in here as outside?

"But when Adam walked through the door finally my luck changed.”

“I am now lucky in love!”

She added: “Of course I am sad not to make the final.

“But I was instantly attracted to Adam, we couldn’t stop staring at each other.

“From that moment onwards we have been building on our instant connection ever since but we’re going to take it slow.

“It’ll be nice to be out of the villa and go on dates.”

Tom Clare and Molly Smith are favourites to win tonight’s final, followed by Callum Jones and Jess Gale.
