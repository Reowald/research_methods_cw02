Quayside, Exeter

This enclave sits alongside the meeting of the River Exe and the Exeter Ship Canal, at the tip of the long Riverside Valley Park, which tracks the river out to the sea. It is packed with shops (with a focus on Devonshire antiques and crafts), restaurants and homes. Quayside has its own events schedule: there’s the Shanty festival in September and live jazz at the Transit Shed. This Grade II-listed, three-bedroom house is for sale a few streets back from the water, with fruit trees in the south-facing garden. £900,000. Winkworth , 01392 271 177
