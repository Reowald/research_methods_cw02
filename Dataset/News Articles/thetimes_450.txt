Rivers are at risk from a growing number of US-style “mega farms”.

There are 202 more large-scale farms in the UK, a rise of a fifth, than in 2016 when Michael Gove promised that Brexit would not endanger environmental standards.

“One thing is clear: I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country,” the former environment secretary said. “The future for British farming is in quality and provenance, maintaining high environmental and animal welfare standards.”

However, a new analysis has found that the number of “mega” pig and poultry units across the UK climbed from 974 in 2016 to 1,176 last year.

“These farms have multiple impacts. It’s not just animal welfare. They’re driving climate change, they’re polluting our rivers. The classic case of the moment that people talk about is the river Wye. Agriculture is the number one pollutant of our rivers,” said Anthony Field, head of Compassion in World Farming UK (CIWF UK), an animal welfare campaign group.
