A CAR fanatic "transformed" his car into a Rolls Royce lookalike using a £7 can and a screwdriver.

One motor-lover realised the closest he could get to owning the real deal up-market vehicle was to flip his Mitsubishi.

TikTok account @customcarsmods decked out his car and decided to give it a makeover.

The content creator got to work by ripping parts out and taking a screwdriver to every nook and cranny he could see.

Deciding to take the car's original parts out, the driver then grabbed a cheap and cheerful can of spray paint.

Spraying all of the interior jet black, the owner started to see his vision come to life.

A similar spray paint, can be bought from B&Q for just £7.

The DIY paint job only took 30 minutes to complete.

Wanting to make it even more like a Rolls Royce, he then added star lights into the ceiling as well as a straight pipe.

A three-part video of the renovation was shared with his hundreds of thousands of followers.

The account said: "I can't buy a Rolls Royce. That's the closest to the real deal."

People flocked to the comments to praise the handy work.

One person said: "Your EVO is now 200 times better looking inside."

Another said: "Good start, looks nice."

While a third simply added: "Wow."

It comes after another social media user transformed her car on the cheap.

Lucy, who can be found via her TikTok profile @_fallingasleep, revealed she’d decorated her vehicle.

This included adding gems to the passenger seat and all around it and sparkly shoe brooch style items placed inside the airbag vents to decorate them.
