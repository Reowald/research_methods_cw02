And the winners are...

If you’re waiting until 7pm and planning to watch the Bafta Awards then, look away now…

Surreal black comedy Poor Things has won the Bafta for special visual effects, while The Boy And The Heron has won the best animated film Bafta. Filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki is not at the ceremony so the award was collected by presenters Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott.

Drama film Earth Mama has been honoured with the Bafta for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer. Director Savanah Leaf was sobbing as she took to the stage to be presented with the award for her tale of a pregnant single mother. Leaf said “this is crazy”, adding: “Our lead had never acted before and she poured her heart into this and she was so fearless.” The director was given the award alongside Irish producers Shirley O’Connor and Medb Riordan.

The Zone Of Interest has won the Bafta for a film not in the English language. Director Jonathan Glazer said it was “an out of body experience” to win the award as he paid tribute to his collaborators. Producer James Wilson thanked Glazer for his “virtuosity and his friendship”. He continued: “Walls aren’t new from before or since the Holocaust and it seems stark right now that we should care about innocent people being killed in Gaza or Yemen or Mariupol or Israel.” He added: “Thank your for recognising a film that asks us to think in those spaces.”
