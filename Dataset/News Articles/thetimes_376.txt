The stage show version of The Full Monty bares all in Glasgow from Monday, then visits Aberdeen in March

It’s hard to hear Tom Jones’s rendition of You Can Leave Your Hat On without thinking of Simon Beaufoy’s hit 1997 film about a group of unemployed Sheffield steel workers stripping to make ends meet (and, of course, to learn valuable lessons about themselves). The feelgood stage version is grinding its way to Scotland, with lots of familiar faces in the cast. Look out for Danny Hatchard from EastEnders, Bill Ward from Coronation Street and Jake Quickenden (The X Factor, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here and plenty of live shows), among others. This West End touring show will be back next month (March 19-23, His Majesty’s Theatre, Aberdeen).

Details February 20-24, Theatre Royal, Glasgow; fullmontytheplay.com
