Emma Stone has said her Bafta win for Poor Things is 'doubly meaningful' as it is the first film she has produced and acted in together.

The 35-year-old Hollywood star, who picked up the best leading actress gong, said: 'You put a lot of your heart and soul into making a film.

'A lot of people are away from their families for months at a time and you bond with this group of people.

'And the excitement of it being received, or seen, or loved, by people is immensely meaningful and you don't know if that's going to happen or not.

'If it's gonna resonate with people the way that it does with you.

'And also to be a producer on this film.

'This was the first film that I've produced alongside acting and so it feels doubly meaningful, both in front of (the camera) and behind, it was incredible to be a part of.

'I think for a lot of films that brings people into theatres to see it, it brings more attention to the film.
