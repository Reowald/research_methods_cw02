Cambridge, Cambridgeshire

In the heart of the city is an old shop with what was once a stable for the grocer’s yard – they are now a house and a guesthouse. The front door opens on to a hall that flows into the open-plan kitchen, where light pours in through the original shop window. There are four bedrooms and a cellar in the main house, and one bedroom in the guesthouse. It is in Mawson Road, near university hubs such as the cricket club, and within walking distance of other student staples such as the Camra multi-award-winning real ale pub, the Cambridge Blue. £1.6m.
