Woods is driven off the course after withdrawing during the second round of the Genesis Invitational in Los Angeles

The 15-times major champion was taken away on a golf cart during the second round of the Genesis Invitational tournament in Los Angeles on Friday

Tiger Woods’ comeback to the PGA Tour ended prematurely last night after he withdrew from the Genesis ­Invitational in California during his second round.

Woods, 48, is still adapting to playing after ankle fusion surgery, having ­undergone treatment in April last year after pulling out of the Masters during the third round. The surgery was to address lingering pain in his right foot from injuries suffered in a 2021 car crash. Woods did not compete again until the Hero World Challenge in December.
