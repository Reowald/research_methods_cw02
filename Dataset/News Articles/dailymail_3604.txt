Kourtney Kardashian showed off her famous figure with a set of sizzling selfies on Friday.

The 44-year-old reality star - who jetted down to Australia to catch husband Travis Barker's Blink-182 concerts - took to Instagram to share pics rocking a daring red gown while admiring Travis' Valentine's Day gift of red roses.

Looking like she stepped off the runway, the beauty stunned in the skintight dress featuring long sleeves and fur-trimmed cuffs.

She posed like a pro, hands delicately placed under her chin, while leaning gracefully next to the gigantic vase that held the gorgeous flowers.

The bloom is clearly one of Kourtney's favorite, as Travis used hundreds of them in a grand display when he proposed to the POOSH founder in 2022.
