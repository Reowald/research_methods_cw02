I hope Frank DM Wilson was joking in recommending the building of a 500-metre-high tower in Waterloo and the replacement of the current South Bank buildings on a similar scale (Letters, 13 February). I live further upstream on the Thames at Vauxhall, and the jumble of high‑rises between here and Battersea is a solid reminder of how such developments are the very opposite of “inspiring” and bring nothing to our environment and quality of life. I note that he lives in Cambridge, where such nonsense is quite rightly kept at bay.

Re Lola Okolosie’s article (Why are kids doing the ‘Brexit tackle’? They’re having fun at adults’ expense – and mocking our toxic politics, 14 February), not long ago we had lunch in a village pub in Ireland, near Cork. Among desserts on the menu was an item named “Brexit”. We asked what it was and were told: “It’s now our name for Eton mess.”

Re your report (Michael Gove says no-fault evictions will be banned this year, 11 February), I hope that evictions where fault is proven will continue, specifically from Downing Street.
