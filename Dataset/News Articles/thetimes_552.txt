From extraordinary sushi to five-star hotels, game-changing curry to alfresco riverside dining, the food critic recalls some of his most deliciously extravagant London restaurant experiences.

The best, the oldest, the sine qua non. The grandest dining room in London. Waiters dressed like Toscanini at Bayreuth, who are also chilled and friendly and part of the fun. Duck in two servings, carved at the table, crêpe suzette flambéed right there, lobster, veal sweetbreads in madeira, turbot with caviar … oh my days. I took a couple of cousins at the end of last year and we drank Corton-Charlemagne and fine Tokaji and I spent thousands, thousands, and giggled all the way home at what wonderful value it was.

It looks like a dodgy location at first: up at the top of the old Television Centre in Shepherd’s Bush, a stone’s throw from the mums-on-tequila hellfest of White City House, but it’s convenient for Queen’s Park Rangers so I gave it a try when it opened. Best. Meal. I. Had. Ever. Had. I gave it 10/10 across the board for the first time ever, in 20 years of reviewing. The sushi master Endo Kazutoshi is a gorgeous playful nutter, who places each dazzling mouthful of the 20 or so that he prepares individually and sequentially, into your very hands across the beautiful wooden counter top with room for only 14 diners, while you stare out across west London and hope the bill comes in south of a million pounds.

Generally speaking the quality of food served in a restaurant on the top of a hotel is inversely proportional to the quality of the view you get to look at while eating it. But not here. Here, they serve the best Peking duck in three servings — crispy skin with sugar, sliced breast meat with hoisin sauce and pancakes, then with rice or noodles — for £95 a pop, plus terrific dim sum, a smashing wine list, gorgeous service and those views.

4. The River Café

Once a year I come here and do a couple of grand with three mates on pasta and a bit of fish. It’s always, always sunny, there is always a boss table outside, the staff are gorgeous, the manager Charles Pullan orchestrates the magic like a well-spoken Willy Wonka, everyone but everyone is always there, it is unquestionably the best waterside restaurant in Britain and, as everyone always remembers only when they get there, you can’t even see the river!

5. Gymkhana

The best Indian restaurant in Europe, end of. It stunned London when it opened on Albemarle Street in 2013 and introduced the world to Karam, Jyotin and Sunaina Sethi, whose company, JKS Restaurants, has gone on to open nine or ten of my favourite places. Inside, the glamour is a little bit Raj — which disgruntles the odd lefty — but it’s so cosy and fun, and the food is so terrific I just don’t see how anyone could quibble. There is duck egg bhurji, lobster, Malabar paratha, life-changing kid goat methi keema, epochal muntjac biryani (with a pastry top!) and if you are going to spend £29 on lamb rogan josh or £48 on tandoori masala lamb chops, believe me, Gymkhana is the place to do it.

6. Scott’s

Don the doorman is an old mate and I always stop and talk to him when I’m passing through Mount Street to get a haircut at John Frieda or a diamond knob stud at Pragnell. We chat about the old days and then I ask if he can sort a table for me and my mum at one of the commemorative Charles Saatchi strangling tables on the pavement, because it is the last place left in London where the old girl can chainsmoke while poking at a £75 Dover sole, while I see off a bottle of Meursault with my six tempura oysters and Mangalorean monkfish and tiger prawn curry. Never less than 300 quid and I let her pay, because it’s the smart way around inheritance tax.

7. Defune

It doesn’t look much but until the Mayfair omakase boom of the last five years it was the only way a London sushi junkie could come close to the purity and purpose of the Tokyo experience. I went with an old roué 30 years ago who said, “Leave it to the man — they’ll charge us what they think we can afford,” and so the old sushi master (or “itamae”) passed over his counter to us scallop sashimi and hamachi, nigiri of otoro and chutoro, uni, unagi, handrolls … the best fish, rice, wasabi I had ever eaten. And they charged us about £100 each, which was a lot then. These days I go once a year with my fellow restaurant critic Tom Parker-Bowles and they charge us maybe twice that. I’m flattered they think we can afford it.

8. Mount St Restaurant

I wasn’t all that crazy about the £96 lobster pie that the King and Queen apparently liked when they came here. A bit rich for my blood. Perhaps it has to be blue. But I bloody loved the omelette Arnold Bennett, the “Pigeons in Pimlico”, the venison, the wine list, the art by Freud and Matisse, the smooth service and the lovely Mayfair light bouncing around the room off the salmon pink brick outside. I paid £300, £400, something like that. I don’t really remember. I’m on expenses, innit?

9. Sushi Kanesaka

I went because it was the most expensive menu in London: £420 before booze and 15 per cent service. Not a very engaging room. Too small. Too intimate a space to share with five or six people you don’t know, who, to have this kind of money, probably have to do something that involves killing people. Or at the very least not caring too much if people get killed. And it’s above the ghastly Cut by Wolfgang Puck (watch those spoonerisms!) at the 45 Park Lane development. But you cannot get better fish in London. Or possibly anywhere.

I loved Jeremy Chan and Iré Hassan-Odukale’s crazy modern Nigerian-inspired joint right from the start because the cooking was brilliant, the vision and ambition were unlike anything London had at that time, and those two guys were just lovely. It has gone from strength to strength (despite some sniffing in the early days from Nigerian visitors about what is and is not jollof rice — a debate that I gather can be had over literally any bowl of jollof rice) and is right at the top of the London tree for genuine progressive cooking with a sense of fun. I’ve not been back since it moved location and got two Michelin stars, because I am not allowed to review things twice, and on my own dollar I just can’t afford it.
