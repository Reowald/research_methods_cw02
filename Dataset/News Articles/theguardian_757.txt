What time are you up? I start spreading my toes at around 10am. That’s the time I should be in the gym and my brain is aware of it. ‘You should be in the gym,’ I think. I feel so much better leaving the gym than I do walking in.

What’s for breakfast? I’m into toast lately. I’m digging sourdough with English or Irish salted butter. Sometimes I put a little honey on it, or avocado or blueberry jam. Depends on my mood.

Bit of fresh air? I have two Vizslas, Jack and Jimmy. They’re Hungarian bird dogs that need to run a lot, so we take them to the park, let them off the leash and they go up and down saying hi to everybody.

Sundays growing up? Our house was in Florida, about 12 blocks from the ocean, so I’d throw beach towels, sun lotion and a snack into the basket of my bike and cycle to this surf spot that people hung out at. I’d spend the day surfing and watching the waves. I did that from the age of nine or 10.

A Sunday to remember? A few weeks ago I learned I’m having a granddaughter. My son invited us to his house and had us open a pressie. It was an Etch A Sketch with the news written on it. They watched me reading it and I started to cry. I was so happy, I didn’t hit the ground for about an hour.

Sunday evening? I’m reading Barbra Streisand’s My Name is Barbra. It’s hard to get into at the beginning, but if you force yourself to stay with it, it’s worth it. Or there is always Netflix.

Ever get the Sunday night blues? Sure, I think everybody does. People would be lying if they say they didn’t get them. It’s a normal reaction to be, like: ‘What time is left that I can call my own?’ Sunday nights belong to me!
