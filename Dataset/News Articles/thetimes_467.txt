When I was ten years old I stood on the banks of a river in Northern Ireland and caught my first little wild brown trout. My heart never beat faster in its life. It ignited within me a passion that burns just as strongly to this day.

Fast forward 55 years and I’d become chairman of the oldest fly fishing club in the UK, the Amwell Magna Fishery. For almost 200 years it has had the River Lea’s last breeding population of wild brown trout, downstream from Hertford. They can trace their ancestors back 8,000 years to fish that swam down the Rhine.

We were watching that river be destroyed. That got me interested in talking to the Environment Agency (EA) and Thames Water. We tried to take the EA to the High Court. When the EA realised that this was getting serious we managed to resolve our issue at Amwell Magna quickly. And I’m grateful for that.
