NetBet Offering best odds guaranteed on racing in the UK and Ireland, and cash out on both single and multiple wagers, NetBet should be given consideration by day-to-day horse racing punters. Cash out is available on selected race card bets and each-way wagers, although the option is disabled once the race starts. NetBet regularly run promotions, including offering extra places on certain races on a daily basis, which may factor into your thinking when deciding to cash out a bet.

Full cash out vs partial cash out Having the option to cash out all or part of your bet offers punters greater flexibility over their wagers. Here’s a breakdown of the difference between a full and partial cash out, and some of the reasons why you might select one of these options on the best online betting sites for cash out: Full cash out A full cash out settles the entire wager at the price offered by the bookmaker, regardless of the final outcome.

A full cash out offers peace of mind that either a profit has been locked in or losses have been minimised.

Cashing out fully could mean the bettor misses out on a bigger payout should their selection go on to win as the cash out amount is rarely as great as the returns generated by a winning bet. Partial cash out Partial cash out gives bettors the chance to settle part of the wager while the rest is left in play for the remainder of the event.

Punters can often choose how much of the bet they want to cash out with bookmakers offering to settle between 10 and 90 per cent of the wager at the user’s discretion.

A partial cash out opens the door to making a profit from both the cash out and the original bet, should it go on to win.

A partial cash out doesn’t offer the same security as a full cash out and carries a bigger risk of making a loss.

When to Cash Out Your Bets Understanding the value of cashing out is the first step when deciding whether you want to settle a wager early or let it ride. By settling a bet before an event finishes, you are potentially missing out on a bigger return, but there are plenty of reasons why cashing out can be the smart choice sometimes. Common reasons to cash out include: When there’s a degree of uncertainty about the final outcome of the event.

The desire to secure a profit before an event is over.

The chance to lock in a significant return from an accumulator.

When the cash out value exceeds your expected returns on a wager.

The need to adjust your betting strategy on an event in real time.

When you want to minimise potential losses if your bet is going against you. Cash Out Terms and Conditions Before cashing out a bet or placing a wager with one eye on potentially settling it early, always check the cash out terms and conditions offered by a bookmaker. Here are some of the more common conditions applied by betting sites when it comes to cashing out: Cash out is only available on selected markets and bet types.

A time delay of a few seconds is applied before a cash out is confirmed.

The cash-out amount may be subject to fluctuations based on live event conditions.

Cashing out can invalidate certain and promotions.

Auto Cash Out Auto cash out has become a third string on a bettors’ cash out bow and gives punters the option to agree upon a return before an event. Rather than waiting to cash out in-play, which is where most cash outs occur, auto cash out means you don’t have to be on a betting site when the event is taking place to get paid out early. Auto cash out allows a user to make a bet and then set a profit amount for that bet. Should the cash out value exceed the specified amount then the bet will be settled automatically. Some bookmakers offer partial auto cash out, most notably bet365, where you select a specific amount of the cash out value that you want to be settled before the end of the event. The remainder of your stake will be left in play and any further returns will be worked out come the conclusion of the event. How to use cash out at a betting site Cashing out a bet should be a straightforward process, requiring just a few steps, whether you are on a bookmaker’s desktop site or mobile app: Find the cash out section. This is usually located on the bet slip or my bets section of a betting site.

Select the bet you would like to cash out.

Be sure to compare the original stake, cash out sum and full return on the bet to determine whether the cash out sum offers value for money before proceeding.

Decide whether you want to complete a full or partial cash out.

Confirm the cash-out request.

Types of cash out Most bookmakers tend to offer at least a full cash out option, but some also offer partial or auto cash out. As the names suggest, there is a difference between the three cash out options; Full cash out: A bettor is offered a certain amount to settle their bet in full, be that a single or multiple wager, before the event they’ve bet on has concluded. If selected, the bettor will be paid the amount offered by the operator, no matter the final outcome of the event.

If selected, the bettor will be paid the amount offered by the operator, no matter the final outcome of the event. Partial cash out: A bettor can choose to settle part of their wager and leave the rest running with a partial cash out. Punters can usually select how much of the bet they would like to cash out, ranging from 10 to 90 per cent of the full cash out amount. The rest of the bet will be settled at the conclusion of the event.

The rest of the bet will be settled at the conclusion of the event. Auto cash out: Bettors can select an amount they would be happy to cash out for, usually between the current cash out value and the maximum amount of winnings possible from the wager. Unlike full and partial cash outs on events in-play, users do not need to go back to the bet once an auto cash out value has been set. How cash out works Cash out is the process of settling all or part of a wager before the event has concluded. Bookmakers use algorithms to work out a cash out sum based on several factors, including your original stakes, current odds and potential winnings. They will then offer you an amount to settle the bet early. If the punter takes the cash out option, they will be paid the agreed upon amount and the bet will be marked as settled, if they took a full cash out. In the case of a partial cash out, the bet will remain open but with a new payout amount, depending on the size of the partial cash out.

Why betting sites offer cash out Nearly every major UK bookmaker offers some form of cash out now, such is its popularity amongst punters and betting site operators. For bettors, cash out offers greater flexibility and control over their bets, allowing them to lock in a profit or minimise any potential losses before an event is concluded. There’s also an opportunity for punters to get paid twice if they can secure a profit from a partial cash out and their bet goes on to win. For bookmakers, it’s a chance to minimise their losses on a bet which may cost them more in the future by taking a small hit now. Cash out markets Cash out is now offered across a wide variety of sports and markets, although not every bet is eligible for cash out. It’s worth checking whether a bookmaker offers cash out on the market or bet type you would like to wager on before placing a bet. Typically, bookmakers offer cash out on single or accumulator bets covering the more popular markets. For those betting on football, they can usually find cash out available on the match result, correct score, total goals and goalscorer markets. For racing, win only and to place bets are often covered by cash out. The best cash out betting sites will also cover tennis, boxing, NFL, darts, rugby and more with their cash out option.
