Snapchat was viewed as a visionary product but despite the photo and video-sharing app having millions of subscribers, it has failed to turn a profit — so far

When Snap, the parent of Snapchat, floated in 2017, its investment bankers at Goldman Sachs pitched the deal as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to back a Steve Jobs-style product visionary. How else could they sell a deal that handed imperial power to its 26-year-old billionaire founder, Evan Spiegel?

He and Bobby Murphy, his co-founder and former Stanford University fraternity brother, were given 96 per cent control of the voting shares in the photo and video-sharing app that is beloved by young people. That structure meant investors would be “entitled to ‘no’ vote on matters submitted to our stockholders”. They would be spectators only. As if to press home that point, the company gave Spiegel an $850 million bonus simply for pulling off the float.
