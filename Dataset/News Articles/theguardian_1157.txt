We use Thums Up, India’s favourite cola, for this, as befits our roots at Dishoom, but any cola could be used in its place. It’s a great premix, too: once the drink is made up, bottle it, seal and keep in the freezer for whenever the mood takes you. And make some for friends, too, while you’re about it.

Cola sazerac

Serves 4

For the cola reduction (makes 300ml, or enough for 5 servings)

800ml cola

250g white sugar

5g cinnamon sticks

25ml lime juice

For the drink (per 500ml bottle)

60ml cola reduction (see above and method)

150ml rye whiskey – we use Woodford Reserve

150ml cognac – we use H by Hine

8ml absinthe

10ml Peychaud’s Bitters

First make the cola reduction. Pour the cola in a large pan and stir until it’s no longer fizzy. Slowly heat the cola to 80C (use a thermometer or probe), then stir in the sugar in batches until it’s completely dissolved. Bring the cola syrup mix up to 120C, then keep it there for half an hour, to reduce.

Add the cinnamon, keep at 120C for a further 30 minutes, to reduce by about half, then take off the heat and stir in the lime juice. Strain to remove the cinnamon, then decant into a clean bottle or jar, seal and store in the fridge.

To build the drink, measure everything into a large jug or bowl, add 75ml water and stir to combine. Decant into a clean bottle, seal and store in the freezer. To serve, pour a 125ml measure into a chilled gimlet or coupe glass.
