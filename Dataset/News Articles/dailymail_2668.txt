The world's most powerful passports for 2024 have been revealed - and for the first time six countries share the top spot in the list.

The global ranking indicates the number of countries citizens around the world can enter visa-free.

This year, four EU member states — France, Germany, Italy, and Spain — join Japan and Singapore in boasting the most powerful passports in the world, with their citizens able to visit an astonishing 194 destinations out of 227 around the globe visa-free.

The UK has held its 2023 position of fourth, having slid down the table over the previous six years. Its citizens - along with those from Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway and Portugal - can visit 191 countries visa-free. Australia also maintains its position, in sixth place, with visa-free access to 189 countries.

Meanwhile the U.S continues to hold firm in seventh, with access to 188 countries visa-free. But it is still some way off its 2014 ranking, when it came joint first with the UK.

The list has been produced by the Henley Passport Index, which is based on exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association (Iata). It analyses how many countries a passport holder can enter without a prior visa.

The most recent study reveals that Finland, South Korea and Sweden have the world's second most powerful passports with visa-free access to 193 countries, while the populations of Austria, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands (joint third) can all access 192 countries visa-free.

Afghanistan remains entrenched at the bottom of the index, with a visa-free access score of just 28 (up from 27 last year), followed by Syria (29); Iraq (31); Pakistan (34); Yemen (35) and Somalia (36) - the six weakest passports in the world.

Palestinian Territory is slightly ahead with a visa-free access score of 40, ranking it joint 98th with Nepal and Libya.

French citizens can travel to 194 destinations out of 227 around the globe visa-free

The UAE remains the biggest climber on the Henley Passport Index over the past decade, adding 106 destinations to its visa-free score since 2014. This has resulted in 'a massive leap of 44 places in the ranking from 55th to 11th position', the firm said.

Ukraine and China are also among the top five countries with the most improved rankings over the past 10 years - seeing a net total gain of 21 places each - and both have climbed a further two ranks in the past year. Ukraine is now in 32nd place with 148 visa-free destinations and China is 62nd on the ranking with access to 85 destinations without a prior visa, compared to just 44 in 2014.

Dr Christian Kaelin, chairman of Henley & Partners and the inventor of the passport index concept, said although the general trend over the history of the 19-year-old ranking has been towards greater travel freedom, the global mobility gap between those at the top and bottom of the index is now wider than ever.

He said: 'The average number of destinations travelers are able to access visa-free has nearly doubled from 58 in 2006 to 111 in 2024. However, as we enter the new year, the top-ranked countries are now able to travel to a staggering 166 more destinations visa-free than Afghanistan.'

Key global mobility and migration trends in 2024

Commenting in the Henley Global Mobility Report 2024 Q1, released alongside the latest Henley Passport Index, award-winning journalist and author Misha Glenny, said there’s only one piece of advice needed in the new year: Brace yourself for more uncertainty.

He commented: 'In 2024, 40 countries making up over 50 per cent of global GDP will undergo decisive elections, including the US and several other major powers. Political trends point to a lack of geopolitical coordination heightening the risk of prospective shocks to an already precarious economic environment.

'The general trend, however, remains steady. A decline in American and European influence and a jostling for power among the Asian big boys.'

The U.S continues to hold firm in seventh, with access to 188 countries visa-free

Former career diplomat with the U.S Department of State, Annie Pforzheimer, said immigration remains one of the most intractable issues in American politics.

She said: 'As the year begins, the political temperature in the US regarding uncontrolled migration through Mexico is threatening to derail other national priorities, leading to speculation that the country might attempt long-delayed immigration reforms.

'Even the Biden administration has called the asylum system "broken".'

Immigration is also 'a highly salient political issue' in the UK ahead of its general election this year, according to Dr Hannah White OBE, director for the Institute for Government.

Commenting in the report, she said: 'The UK has seen unprecedented inward migration following the introduction of its post-Brexit migration regime. This increase has proven awkward for the governing Conservative party, which committed in its 2019 election manifesto to cut annual net migration to under a quarter of a million.'

Turning to the Middle East, Dr Robert Mogielnicki, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said despite the 'devastating effects' of the Israel–Hamas conflict, governments in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region hope to continue the economic momentum of 2023 in the year ahead.

'The GCC has agreed to establish a Schengen-like visa system, enabling tourists to travel seamlessly throughout the region,' he added.
