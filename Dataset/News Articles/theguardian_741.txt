In the midst of the UK's deepening cost of living crisis, John Harris and John Domokos go in search of hope, touring England and Wales to meet the new breed of community activists dealing with hunger, poverty, and loneliness, but who are also trying to push towards a better future. All the groups covered in this video are part of Locality, one of two charities the Guardian is partnering with for its charity appeal.

Locality and Citizens Advice are at the heart of the voluntary response to rising poverty and hardship in some of the UKâ€™s most deprived neighbourhoods. Their vital work delivers immediate crisis support and hope for the future.
