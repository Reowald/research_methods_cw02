‘Although we shot on physically built sets on a soundstage, I wanted to shoot the film as if we were on location, meaning with little or no equipment or lighting around the actors. To achieve this, many scenes were lit only from the outside and with practical lights by our DOP Robbie Ryan. Part of the film was shot on Ektachrome, a much more vivid and vibrant celluloid – which contrasts from the black and white stock of the first part of the film in such a way as to suggest how Bella’s world is changing before our eyes’
