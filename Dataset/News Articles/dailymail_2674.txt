It is no longer such a novelty to go glamping or book a staycation.

So how about indulging in a 'picklecore' break or going on a 'sportcation'? Perhaps a 'relactive' trip away?

According to experts, these are the holiday trends set to light up our imaginations in 2024.

Picklecore refers to the sport of pickleball, which combines tennis, ping pong and badminton, and is loved by celebrities including Emma Watson, Kim Kardashian and George Clooney. It is now possible to plan an entire trip away around the pastime.

Similarly, sportcations are holidays centred around activities, while relactive getaways refer to trips that involve relaxing by being active.

Also among the trends, which have been forecasted by active holiday company Neilson Beach Clubs, is 'boomerang tourism' â€“ in which grown-up children join their parents for multi-generational holidays. There's also the 'solo-moon', where travellers go away by themselves.

A survey by OnePoll for the travel firm found 91 per cent of holidaymakers participated in a combination of activities while on holiday in 2023.

Paddleboarding, fitness classes, and water skiing were the activities guests enjoyed the most, followed by wakeboarding and mountain biking.

David Taylor, CEO at Neilson Beach Clubs, said: 'People are increasingly using their time away from work to not only recharge their batteries mentally but stay in shape physically.

'We call this switching off by switching on.'
