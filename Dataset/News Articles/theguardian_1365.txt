Comments

127 entries, the only mistakes I spotted being in two entries with SINKAGE for SONDAGE, which I didn’t feel I could accept. (I always aim to give you the definition for the clue word as close as possible to what’s in Chambers, picking one of the meanings listed if there are several.) Your favourite clue, of 14 mentioned, was ‘Harms body, one slashed terribly in neck – sign of triad?’ for CHORD SYMBOL. The general feeling seems to have been (a) that this was an unusually tough puzzle overall (which I can understand, given the high percentage of less common words), and (b) that the clue word was uninspiring, which I find it less easy to sympathize with. I thought its meanings and component letters would offer a reasonable range of possible treatments – easy to say, perhaps, when spared the task you faced.

A few entry words foxed some of you, principally FOUR, RAHU and TEAN. I hope the solution notes will have explained these adequately. I thought that my reference to Rahul Gandhi would be easy enough to spot, given that he is regularly in the news as a member of the most famous modern Indian political dynasty (though not on a par with his mother or his grandfather) and a target for Narendra Modi’s (jealous?) vindictiveness.

Advance warning that my annual family holiday next month will mean a slight delay in the announcement of the competition results and the slip – no more than a week, I hope. We’re hoping that the tropical weather currently scorching the south of France and other Mediterranean countries doesn’t move north to affect Brittany.
