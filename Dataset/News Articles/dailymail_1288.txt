FRANCE 4-2 CROATIA - MARTIN SAMUEL AT THE LUZHNIKI STADIUM: An old fashioned scoreline, but a very modern performance. France gave this World Cup the send-off it deserved, and the champions, too. At times they rode their luck and Croatia were their equals, at least, for much of the game. Ultimately, though, France had too much for them. They won by a scoreline last seen in 1966 - and previously in 1930 and 1938 - but this is very much a 21st century team. They are organised and selfless as a defensive unit, they have the world's most exciting new talent in Kylian Mbappe - who has made the biggest impact of any teenager at a World Cup since Pele - and they have reacquainted us all with the Paul Pogba Manchester United bought, rather than the one Old Trafford has witnessed.
