The kicked-out All Stars returned to the ITV villa to choose who they wanted out next.

The Islanders were left shocked after their old pals made a comeback to the ITV show. On Sunday night, Arabella Chi and Adam Maxted were given the boot and didn't make it to the final.

Islanders were left gobsmacked when their friends were given the power to choose the finalists. The stars didn't take it lightly and argued their place after each vote.

Arabella and Adam and Georgia and Anton were left neck and neck at the fire pit. Both were battling it to try and fight for the place to stay.

Joe Garratt had the deciding vote between the two and was left to deliver the bad news. However, he put his decision down to them being not as "strong as the rest".

Arabella revealed she "expected it" when the answer was confirmed by the TV star. The model was left in tears after she explained the "journey" she had been on.

During her exit interview with host Maya Jama, Arabella revealed that she believes the Islanders had made the wrong decision and should've voted for Anton and Georgia.

She ranted about her "friends" Hannah Elizabeth and Joanna Chimonides had voted for her for the wrong reasons. ITV viewers also shared their thoughts online.

One wrote: "Surely if everyone is saying the same thing about Arabella and Adam then it’s not an “excuse” lol canny stand her #LoveIsland" A second added: "Arabella and Adam aren’t lasting till the reunion please lord #LoveIsland"
