John Wick fans can step into the blood-soaked shoes of Keanu Reeves' super-assassin and 'live out the fantasy, action, and danger' depicted in the hit franchise in a new interactive attraction opening at Area15 in Las Vegas later this year.

The John Wick Experience recreates The Continental hotel haven for the fantastical criminal underworld inside a 12K-square-foot space also featuring a themed bar and retail shop - according to The Wrap.

Fans will be shuttled through a party, tasked with specific missions, trusted with secrets, drawn into the culture, and invited to private areas during the high-stakes adventure alongside actors in a form of immersive theatre.

The John Wick Experience was co-created by franchise director Chad Stahelski, who partnered with Egan Productions (the same company behind Saw, Blair Witch, and Hunger Games-themed escape rooms).

Keanu Reeves starred in the first four John Wick films - spanning 2014-2023 - which amassed a combined $1B at the global box office with each one bigger and better reviewed than the last.

The 59-year-old action star will next reprise his titular role in Len Wiseman's Ballerina - hitting US/UK theaters June 7 - which stars Ana de Armas as the vengeful dancer Rooney previously played by Unity Phelan in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum.

The late Lance Reddick, Ian McShane, Anjelica Huston, Gabriel Byrne, Norman Reedus, and Catalina Sandino Moreno will also appear in Ballerina.

Fans worried about Wick's fate at the 'ambiguous' end of John Wick: Chapter 4 can rest easier knowing a fifth film is already in the works.

Peacock had its biggest original launch of 2023 with its seventies-set prequel series The Continental: From the World of John Wick despite scoring a tepid 63% critic approval rating (out of 79 reviews) on Rotten Tomatoes.

Speaking of Lionsgate, Keanu is currently hard at work playing an angel wing-clad mystery character on the set of Aziz Ansari's feature directorial debut Good Fortune.

The action comedy also stars Aziz, Seth Rogen, and Keke Palmer.

On Monday, Reeves' alternative rock band Dogstar announced their 13-date European and UK Summer Tour, which kicks off May 30 at Spain's La Sala Teatro in Madrid.

Tickets go on sale this Friday at 10am PST for the LA grunge trio consisting of the vocalist-bass player, drummer Robert Mailhouse, and frontman-guitarist Bret Domrose.

Keanu will next compete for two trophies - male movie star of the year and action movie star of the year - at the 49th People's Choice Awards, which air this Sunday on NBC.
