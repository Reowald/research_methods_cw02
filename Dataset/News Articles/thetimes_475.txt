Wind farm operators are often paid to switch off their turbines

Regulator will take enforcement action if operators exaggerated their production when told to switch off

Estimated energy output from wind farms should be subject to independent checking, according to MPs, after claims that operators overestimate ­production to reap financial benefits.

Wind farm operators are often paid to switch off their turbines when generation outstrips demand to prevent the electricity grid from being overloaded. These curtailment payments are based on the amount of energy that a wind farm company says it will produce.

However, a Bloomberg analysis of 30 million records found that some ­operators overestimate their output, which boosts the amount of money they receive from National Grid.

Ofgem, the energy watchdog, said it had opened an investigation into the “alleged behaviour” and that “if it finds evidence of egregious action or market abuse, enforcement action will follow”.
