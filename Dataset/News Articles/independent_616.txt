Creators of The Simpsons: Hit and Run have admitted they are perplexed as to why the game never got a sequel.

The title was a hit upon its release in 2003 and developed a cult following that continues to this day, with many gamers still sharing videos of their playthroughs on YouTube.

Initially, early production began on a Hit and Run sequel at Radical Entertainment, but it was cancelled shortly after.

Recently, executive producer John Melchoir and designer Darren Evenson voiced their annoyance that the sequel was never made.

"It was a really bizarre decision," Melchoir said.
