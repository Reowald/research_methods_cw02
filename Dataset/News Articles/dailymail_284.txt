A woman arrested on suspicion of murdering three children in Bristol was 'having a hard time' with her newborn baby, neighbours said last night, as they paid tribute to the 'lovely' kids.

Police officers tragically found the youngsters dead at a home on Blaise Walk, Sea Mills, in the early hours of Sunday morning after receiving a concern for welfare call.

The 42-year-old woman, said locally to be a Sudanese national who has lived in the city since 2017, was then taken to hospital where she is being held in police custody.

While Avon and Somerset Police have not revealed any details about the children, locals believe a boy, aged around eight, a girl, thought to be around four, and a baby boy, between six-months to a year old, were found in the property.

One woman, wished to remain anonymous, said said: 'She was lovely, her kids were lovely, they were nice people. I think she was having a hard time with her newborn.'

The neighbour said that the two eldest children had attended the local Sea Mills primary school. The school announced it would remain closed on this morning and reopen at 1.30pm.

A 42-year-old Bristol taxi driver said he had last seen the mother two weeks ago. He said: 'She was happy. Her kids were all happy.'

The man said the family were part of the Sudanese community in Bristol. He added: 'She is a very nice person. It is very sad.'

Others described the woman as 'really gentle' and 'really lovely' who 'always had a smile on her face'.

The force has not confirmed the name of the woman or her relationship to the children who were pronounced dead at the scene shortly after officers arrived at around 12.40am on Sunday. The children's cause of death is yet to be confirmed.

A heavy police presence remained in the area much of yesterday, with photos showing part of the road cordoned off, with multiple police cars and a forensic team on the scene.

A gathering at a local church was held in memory of the children last night, locals added, while a local playground announced it would be closed today.

Tributes have since flooded in from those within the Sea Mills community who have been left rocked by the tragedy.
