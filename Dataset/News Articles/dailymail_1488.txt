The hosts are usually formidable at home and rarely taste defeat on own soil

England secured a historic victory over India in the first Test in Hyderabad on Sunday, largely in thanks to Ollie Pope and Tom Hartley.

Pope hit 196 in the second innings to help England recover from a first innings deficit of 190 runs in a knock few saw coming following his awkward effort in his first attempt.

Hartley then took seven wickets as he recovered from his own first innings troubles, leading the line for the visitors with the ball on Test debut.

Ben Stokes' side will now go into the rest of the series with momentum on their side and hopes of pulling off one of the most famous away series wins ever.

Here, Mail Sport's Lawrence Booth takes you through some of the stats you might have missed from a thrilling fourth day in Hyderabad.

England secured a historic victory against India after training by 190 runs after both teams had batted once

Tom Hartley bowled his side to victory, taking seven second innings wickets after struggling the first time around

India's defeat was their first in the 106 Tests when they have had a lead of 100 runs or more at the end of the first innings.

Defeat was only India’s fourth at home in Tests since 2013:

2017: LOST by 333 runs v Australia

2021: LOST by 227 runs v England

2023: LOST by 9 wickets v Australia

2024: LOST by 28 runs v England

England recovered from a first-innings deficit of 190 runs — only twice previously had they overturned a greater deficit in a Test match.

Ollie Pope led the way with the bat, hitting 196 in his side's second effort having struggled with his own first

The victory was set up by Pope. His 196 was the fourth-highest score by a visiting batsman in the second innings of a Test in India.

Hartley led the charge with the ball and recorded the second-best figures by an England spinner on debut:

James Langridge 7-56 v West Indies, 1933

Tom Hartley 7-62 v India, 2024

Jim Laker 7-103 v West Indies, 1948
