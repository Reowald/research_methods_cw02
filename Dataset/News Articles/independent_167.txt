Alexei Navalny’s wife has accused the Kremlin of waiting for traces of the Novichok nerve agent to disappear from his body as she vowed to reveal the names of his killers.

In a video message on Monday, Yulia Navalnaya said: "Vladimir Putin killed my husband... We know exactly why Putin killed Alexei three days ago. We will tell you about it soon.”

It comes as the bruised body of the Putin critic is believed to have been delivered to a morgue at the Salekhard District Clinical Hospital, an anonymous experienced paramedic told the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta Europe on Sunday.

However, Mr Navalny’s mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, and his lawyers were blocked from accessing the morgue on Monday morning, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Meanwhile, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after being poisoned in London with Polonium 210, told Sky News the Russian President had “killed the most prominent politician and the hope of a new Russia” as she called for support from the West for critics of the “monster” Putin.
