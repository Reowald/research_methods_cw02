Xbox has confirmed the first game coming to Xbox Game Pass in August – with Two Point Campus being one of the biggest releases for the platform this month.

Two Point Campus is a management simulator that sees players taking control of a university as an administrator to construct buildings, campus equipment as well as hire staff and improve the curriculum.

The game is scheduled to be released on 9 August and it’s been confirmed as a Game Pass addition on day one, meaning existing subscribers can play it for free at no extra cost.

It will be playable on console, PC and via the cloud, along with a handful of other titles. But as new ones are added to Game Pass, older ones will be taken off the service.
