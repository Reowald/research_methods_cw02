The publisher Bloomsbury is enjoying huge demand for its roster of fantasy novels, notably those of Sarah J Maas. The American author has been called a “publishing phenomenon”

Demand remains strong for tales such as Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, with the break-out to film and TV proving even more lucrative

Nigel Newton, the chief executive of publishing house Bloomsbury, updated the stock market last week with the sort of news most chief executives would have fantasies about. The publisher upgraded its profit outlook for the second time in three months, causing shares to soar to an all-time high. Bloomsbury is enjoying insatiable demand for its slate of fantasy novels, notably those of Sarah J Maas. Newton called the American author a “publishing phenomenon”.

Maas’s latest work is House of Flame and Shadow, the third in the Crescent City series, which tells the story of a half-woman, half-fairy. The book topped bestseller lists in the UK, US and Australia. Bloomsbury, which reports numbers in May, now expects revenues of £329 million, up from £291 million.
