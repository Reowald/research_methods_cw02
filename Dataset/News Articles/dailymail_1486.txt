Horrifying. There is no other word to describe the terrifying video I saw of referee Craig Hicks being chased off the pitch by a Port Vale fan on Saturday.

I still cop disgusting abuse — including death threats — on social media. But it’s incidents like this which make me feel glad to be out of the profession.

I’ve heard horror stories from grassroots football of referees being subjected to this sort of behaviour. I even heard of one being left with a broken jaw by an angry spectator invading the pitch.

But I have never seen a fan leap from the stands, run on to the pitch and chase a referee in a professional game in this country. Referees are used to the verbal abuse but this shows that respect towards officials has reached a new low. Thank goodness Hicks had the presence of mind to get away from this lunatic unscathed.

Just imagine if that fan made physical contact or even threw a punch at him.

But it shouldn’t take a referee being assaulted for action to be taken.

Police have already charged the supporter but now football authorities need to throw the book at him to show in the strongest possible terms that this behaviour is unacceptable.

The way they do that is by issuing a ban. If they don’t, this could have a knock-on effect down the pyramid.

Why would a grassroots referee want to pursue a career in a profession where their safety isn’t guaranteed? This was a dark day for the treatment of officials.
