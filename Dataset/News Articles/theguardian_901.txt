There’s a lot more to Neil Morrissey than you might think. His first ever film role was opposite Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins and Laurence Olivier in 1984 historical mariner drama, The Bounty. He’s appeared with Martin Clunes as a fictitious former new romantic pop group in Hunting Venus and was in the film adaptation of the John Godber rubbish-rugby team drama Up ‘n’ Under. On stage, he’s tackled Robin Hood, Guy and Dolls and Oliver. And he’s had two No 1 singles, Can We Fix It and Mambo No 5, under his guise as the voice of a certain children’s TV character, Bob the Builder.

Morrissey appears in I Am Urban, a memoir of lost children in Leeds with Anna Friel and The Hobbit’s Richard Armitage, which was filmed in 2015 but only released in cinemas late last year, and now comes to digital. He’s a great interviewee, but try to keep it respectful. So, growing up in foster homes, his numerous homemade tattoos, and fooling the nation in BBC Three Spoof documentary Neil Morrissey’s Secret. (And maybe accidentally pooing the bed, we’ll allow). Post your questions below by 6pm on Friday 9 February.
