Kelly starred on Saturday as Man City beat Chelsea 1-0 to draw level with Emma Hayes' team at the top of the Women's Super League.

The 26-year-old was recently linked with a transfer to Paris Saint-Germain which would see her become the highest-paid female player of all time.

While she will post her glamorous outings on social media, which included her remarkable engagement under the Northern Lights, she also posts more down to earth content.

Last week Kelly had a less-than stellar time as she tried her hand at cooking pancakes.

She has five goals and four assists in the WSL this season.
