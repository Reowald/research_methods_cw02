Luton manager Rob Edwards is adamant that Manchester United midfielder Casemiro should have been sent off in Sunday's game at Kenilworth Road.

United prevailed with a 2-1 victory in the Premier League clash, but Casemiro was withdrawn by manager Erik ten Hag at half time having been at risk of getting sent off.

The midfielder had already been booked for a challenge on Amari'i Bell and was subsequently perhaps fortunate not to get a second yellow shortly afterwards after catching Ross Barkley.

Edwards stated that the fact that Casemiro was substituted is an indication that he should have received a red card.

Edwards told Sky Sports: 'The fact that he came off at half time might be a little bit of a telltale sign to how I feel about that one. I'm not going to complain about it right now.'

Casemiro was replaced by Scott McTominay ahead of the second half, with United managing to see out the win.

United had established a two-goal lead after just seven minutes as Rasmus Hojlund scored a brace.

Carlton Morris got a goal back for Luton but it was United who ultimately took all three points.

The result leaves Luton in 17th place in the Premier League, one point above the relegation zone.
