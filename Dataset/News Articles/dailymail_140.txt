Jordan Nobbs found the net in superb style as Aston Villa beat Tottenham

Ceri Holland scored and was sent off as Liverpool won 1-0 at Brighton on Sunday to close the gap on fourth-placed Manchester United.

After 53 minutes, Holland seized on a mistake by Brighton goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley, who passed the ball straight to the Liverpool midfielder and she made no mistake from just inside the penalty area.

The day soured for Holland when she was shown a second yellow card for a late tackle in the 93rd minute, but Liverpool held on to move two points behind United.

Elsewhere, former Arsenal midfielder Jordan Nobbs sunk Tottenham with a superb 20-yard strike to give Aston Villa a surprise 2-1 win.

The 31-year-old drove in from distance on the hour mark to give Villa all three points even without reigning WSL golden boot winner Rachel Daly, who is serving a three-match ban for an off-ball elbow against Bristol City.
