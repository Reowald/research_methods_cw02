An article about the London Chamber Orchestra said “half of the musicians walked out [of their rehearsal]” on the eve of a concert at the Cadogan Hall in protest over unpaid fees. In fact, some musicians had withdrawn before the rehearsal and had to be hurriedly replaced, but none walked out of the rehearsal itself (Musicians walk out of rehearsal after not being paid for five months, 11 February, p7).

An article misquoted the artist Zineb Sedira as saying that Gilane Tawadros, director of the Whitechapel Gallery, directed the film Dreams Have No Titles, which is part of Sedira’s immersive exhibition of the same name. Tawadros featured in the film but did not direct it (‘It’s an invitation to bring your own story...’, 11 February, New Review, p18).

The new Showtown museum in Blackpool is set across 1,000 square metres, not 100 square metres (Towering ambition: Blackpool aims to rise above its tacky image, 11 February, p9).

An article said that the Labour Together group “grew out of [Keir] Starmer’s leadership campaign”, which was in 2020; the group was officially launched in 2016 (After the £28 billion U-turn ... what’s left?, 11 February, p33).

The documentation relating to Sweden’s 1776 freedom of the press act is protected through inclusion on Unesco’s Memory of the World register, not as a “world heritage site” as an article said (Call for Sweden to keep home addresses off the internet after wave of deadly bombings, 11 February, p30).
