SKETCH - THE LECTURE ROOM & LIBRARY, 9 CONDUIT STREET, MAYFAIR, LONDON, THREE MICHELIN STARS: This legendary venue, set in a Grade II listed building, is described as a 'painting that never dries', with the three-star Lecture Room restaurant (top image) undoubtedly a work of art. Designed by Gabhan O'Keefe, it's decorated in shades of orange, with richly upholstered armchairs in purple and crimson, and embellished with fabrics of magenta and silver, with a lavishly painted ceiling reminiscent of a Russian fresco. Willy Wonka would surely approve. A must-visit, of course, are the retro-futurist egg-shaped pods above the East Bar (pictured), produced by French designer and architect Noé Duchaufour-Lawrance.
