Regarding her albums, she mentioned that she wasn't contemplating creating a 'Now' when she recorded and released 'Then'.

Looking back, though, she expressed a sense of destiny, describing it as 'meant to be,' as both albums are dedicated to her husband, Ben.

'Sometimes you have these moments in life where you feel like, "Oh, this was meant to be somehow",' she said. 'And I didn't know that when it was happening then — when I decided to call it This Is Me... Then.'

'I didn't even realize it was capturing a moment in time where I fell in love for the first time in that way and wrote this whole album,' she continued.

'And it was very that thing, and I was like, "Oh, I'll call it This Is Me... Then." And then, you know, as fate would have it — 20 years later — here we are,' she said, referring to her romantic reunion with Affleck.
