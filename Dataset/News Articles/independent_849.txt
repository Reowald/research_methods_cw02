Perfect Cellar has teamed up with The Independent to bring you an evening of wine tasting and exciting discounts.

Join master sommelier Christopher Delalonde, sommelier Jon Cellier and IndyEats editor Hannah Twiggs as they bring their passion for high-quality wines to our studio and your dinner table.

Wine is personal, and only you can dictate which wine is perfect for you. In this expert session, Christopher, Jon and Hannah will lend a helping hand, guiding you to your perfect wine, to build your perfect cellar.

The tasting will focus on two delicious wines from Perfect Cellar, Château Chantelune 2020 and Keet First Verse 2019.

The panel will be discussing their flavour profiles and optimum food pairings, and if you’d like to purchase ahead of the event The Independent has an exclusive 25% off code just for attendees. All you need to do is sign up here and we’ll email you the details.

There will also be exclusive offers and discounts issued to all those joining the event on the night.

Perfect Cellar’s wines are made by producers who have a true passion for making outstanding wines year after year, using sustainable methods to protect their vineyards and heritage, yet delivering incredible products at a great price point.

Our virtual tasting event will take place on Tuesday 27 February on Zoom, between 6.30pm and 7.30pm GMT.

Once signed up you will be able to ask questions to our food and wine experts.
