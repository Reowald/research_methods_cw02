Two years ago, Sir Keir Starmer announced that he was to write the story of his life. It was thought by some in the Labour leaderâ€™s office that a book might give him some positive definition in the eyes of a nonplussed public. The handful of shadow cabinet ministers who were told about the project thought it dangerously stupid. British prime ministers do not write memoirs before they are elected. Too presumptuous. Too gauche. Too American. Anyone who wishes to live in the White House must record their childhood in an airport hardback, but not every candidate can be Barack Obama and none of their books can be Dreams From My Father. Most pile up unread like orders of service at an empty funeral.
