Wood is more easily penetrated by radio waves, so the satellite’s metal communication equipment can be carried inside the magnolia shell

When its life is over it will burn to biodegradable ash when re-entering the atmosphere and will not damage other spacecraft or the ozone layer

Japanese scientists are building the world’s first wooden satellite, in an attempt to reduce the pollution of space by metal junk and its potential effects on the ozone layer.
