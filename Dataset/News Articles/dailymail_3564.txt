The official cast for Dancing with the Stars 2024 has finally been confirmed.

Four-time Gold Logie winner Lisa McCune is set to strut her stuff on the dance floor alongside beloved MasterChef favourite Julie Goodwin and former AFL WAG Nadia Bartel.

They will join singer Samantha Jade, SAS Australia's Ant Middleton, AFL legend Shane Crawford and Olympian and former senator Nova Peris.

Rounding out this year's competitors are comedian Nikki Osborne, Home and Away's James Stewart, Better Homes and Gardens presenter Adam Dovile and chef Hayden Quinn.

'Life is too short to say no to something like this,' Goodwin told The Daily Telegraph.

'Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would be capable of dancing,' she continued

'I have always loved to watch the show, and to watch people dance, but it never occurred to me that one day I might be able to do it too.'

Earlier this month, it was revealed that AFL legend Ben Cousins will also be one of the stars taking to the dancefloor.

The 45-year-old footy star, who has been rebuilding his life in recent years after a fall from grace, explained that part of his redemption arc will include reality TV.

Ben refused shows like SAS Australia, but agreed to do Dancing With The Stars this year, explaining that focusing on a new challenge will aid him in rebuilding his life.

This year's stars are currently in rehearsal.

Dancing with the Stars will premiere on Channel Seven later this year.
