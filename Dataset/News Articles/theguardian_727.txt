The UK capital's ultra-low emission zone charges the drivers of more polluting road vehicles every time they enter the city. But since the Ulez was extended to the whole of London by the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, the backlash has become increasingly ferocious.

Self-styled ‘bladerunners’ are waging a campaign to cut down Ulez cameras, activists wearing inflatable dinosaur outfits track and block mobile vans and protesters regularly turn out to drive anger against the mayor and expansion of the scheme. While many protesters hold legitimate concerns about the Ulez expansion, the Guardian’s Richard Sprenger discovers that conspiracy theories are never far from the surface.
