Former President Donald Trump has hailed a group of truckers planning to boycott New York after the $355 million fraud ruling against him as 'great patriots'.

On Friday a trucker claimed there was a growing national movement of fellow drivers planning to refuse to deliver to New York City from Monday in support of Trump.

After sharing DailyMail.com's article about the planned boycott, Trump posted on Truth Social: 'Such an honor to have so many Great Patriots on the side of freedom!'

He added: 'Joe Biden’s Unfair and Dangerous Weaponization of Law Enforcement is a serious threat to Democracy. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'

The truckers claim they are taking action after the former president was ordered to pay a $355 million fine in a civil fraud verdict by a New York court.

According to Ray, those he had spoken to had already alerted their bosses that as of Monday they would no longer conduct business in the Big Apple

Trump took to Truth Social to praise the truckers

A driver with the username Chicago1Ray, shared a video on X saying he had spoken to 'at least ten' colleagues who all agreed they would start refusing loads to the city on Monday.

It wasn't clear how many truckers were involved, but after Trump hailed their plan on his Truth Social page, Chicago1Ray posted again, saying: 'Trump just posted my video and picture on his Truth Social account, pretty f***en cool...

'God Bless America. God bless Trump and God bless every Truck driver in this country.'

He added later: 'I'm just one of the many millions of truckers who believe in God and love this Country.

'Truckers for Trump ain't just a slogan it's real.'

According to Ray, those he had spoken to had already alerted their bosses about their plans.

In the video, he said: 'I've been on the radio talking to drivers for the last hour, hour fifteen minutes.

'I've talked to at least ten drivers, they're going to start refusing loads in New York City starting Monday.

'I don't know how far across the country this is, or how many truckers are going to start denying loads to New York City.

'I tell you what, you f*** around and find out. We are tired of you leftists f***ing with Trump. Motherf***ers are getting tired of this s**t.

Trump hailed the truckers as 'great patriots' and said it was an 'honor' to have them on his side

'Our bosses ain't gonna care about these loads, we will just go somewhere else. Do you know how f***ing hard it is to get into New York City with one of these?

'I don't wish nothing on nobody, but what I am hearing, this is real. We will see, leave Trump the f**k alone with the bulls***. It's election interference.

'I hate to say it, but truckers are for Trump. Ain't no motherf***ers are for Biden.'

Since sharing the video, others have chimed in on the alleged boycott saying they supported the move.

One person posted: 'Do it! Let us know how we can help! You’re NOT alone in this fight!'

Another added: 'We can always rely on the trucker to restore some semblance of the right thing in response.

'Thank you from the many here on X for your courage to stand up to the Marxist leftists.'

In the ruling on Friday Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump and his company to pay $355 million in penalties, finding he had lied about his wealth for years, to deceive banks, insurers and others by inflating his wealth on financial statements.

He is also banned from being a director in a New York firm for three years.

Speaking outside his Mar-a-lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump went on the offense and lashed out at Engoron and Attorney General Letitia James.

A massive convoy of truckers were seen making its way to migrant hotspots in a bid to shame the White House into tackling the worsening crisis

The former President said: 'I paid approximately $300 million dollars in taxes as the migrants come in and take over New York, and they want me out.

'These are radical left democrats, they are lunatics. Its election interference.'

The former president also said that the case had been brought by the DOJ and Biden and constituted election interference.

Last month, a large MAGA truck convoy named the 'Army of God' traveled towards the southern border due to the ongoing crisis.

They hoped the protest would draw further attention to record numbers of migrants crossing the southern border and into the US.
