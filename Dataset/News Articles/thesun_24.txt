The serial rapist was jailed for crimes against 12 women over 17 years

SERIAL rapist David Carrick has been stripped of his state-funded police pension.

The ex-Met PC, jailed for crimes against 12 women over 17 years, will lose the 65 per cent of it contributed by the force — estimated to be more than £10,000 a year.

If released from prison, Carrick can still receive his personal contribution of 35 per cent.

The forfeiture, backed by Scotland Yard, needed final approval from London mayor Sadiq Khan.

Such forfeitures are usually made when an officer commits a serious crime while on duty and that damages public trust in the police.

Mr Khan said: “David Carrick blatantly abused his position of trust as a police officer to carry out his appalling crimes.

“I have been very clear that steps should be taken to remove the employer contributions of his Met Police pension.

"It has now been decided that David Carrick will lose all these employer contributions.”

Carrick, 49, was jailed for 30 years and formally dismissed from the Met in January last year.
