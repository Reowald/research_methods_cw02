Thomas Muller has admitted that he is 'p**sed off' following Bayern Munich's 3-0 defeat away to Bayer Leverkusen.

The loss, which was inflicted courtesy of goals from Josip Stanisic, Alex Grimaldo and Jeremie Frimpong, leaves Bayern Munich five points adrift of their opponents in the Bundesliga title race.

Muller has been present for Bayern's eleven successive title triumphs but they are in danger of missing out this season.

The 34-year-old admitted that there needs to be more 'energy and freedom' in his team's game.

In an explosive interview, Muller told Sky Sports Germany: 'There are of course some symptoms on the pitch. To be honest, I'm p**sed off.

'To quote Oliver Kahn: What I miss from us players are the balls in the game. We are showing significantly better approaches in training. It's okay to feel pressure, but there needs to be energy and freedom. That's missing in our game.'

Muller added that rather than pinning the blame for the defeat on coach Thomas Tuchel, the Bayern players also need to take respsonsibility.

He said: 'Sometimes we have to speak about us players. It's not just about the coach.

'We have many international players at the highest level, we need to step up our game.'

Muller featured as a substitute against Bayer Leverkusen as he entered the fray in the 60th minute.

Tuchel was livid that Stanisic, who found the net, was able to play against his parent club Bayern.

Bayern face Lazio away in the Champions League in midweek and they will be determined to bounce back when they return to league action with an away game against Bochum.
