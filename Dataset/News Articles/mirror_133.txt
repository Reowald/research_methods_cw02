A teen has died in Shoreditch, east London after he was stabbed late on Saturday - no arrests have been made yet but police are stepping up patrols in the area

A 17-year-old boy has died after he was stabbed in east London with a murder hunt now ongoing.

Emergency services were called to Hackney Road, Shoreditch, at around 10:50pm on Saturday. The victim was found with stab injuries and died at the scene.

Detective Chief Superintendent James Conway said: "My thoughts are with the family of the young person who has tragically lost his life. I can assure them that we will be relentless in seeking to identify whoever was responsible for this murder. Cordons are in place in Hackney Road for forensic examination of the scene and we have launched what will be an extremely thorough investigation, supported by specialists from across the Met. Local people will also see additional patrols in Shoreditch. If you have any concerns or information, please speak with those officers. They are there to support you." A post-mortem and formal identification are yet to take place. No one has been arrested.

The news comes just two weeks after a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a 37-year-old man was stabbed to death in north London. At the start of January, a 23-year-old man was stabbed to death in Finsbury Park and a woman was stabbed to death in South London with a man handing himself into police, claiming to have hurt a woman at her home in Honor Oak.

There were 103 homicides recorded in the capital in 2023, with this figure sadly including 21 teenagers.
