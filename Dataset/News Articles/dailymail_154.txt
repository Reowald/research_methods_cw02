Jaden Philogene produced a superb piece of skill which led to a goal during Hull's 2-1 win over Rotherham, with supporters unable to hide their disbelief.

Hull were trailing 1-0 in the Championship clash, with Rotherham having taken an early lead through Christ Tiehi.

However, a moment of magic from Philogene saw the visitors pull level.

The 22-year-old bamboozled the Rotherham defence with his trickery and then produced a Rabona before the ball deflected in off Cameron Humphreys.

A video taken by a Hull fan in the stands at the New York Stadium emphasised just how impressive Philogene's skill was.
