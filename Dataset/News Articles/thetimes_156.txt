How would you like to be the best dressed and informed person you know? Well, look no further than the Times Luxury newsletter. Every month we offer an exclusive insight into the latest in luxury, whether it’s considered edits of oh-so-magnificent handbags, cars, watches and jewels, or thoughtful conversations by some truly excellent writers — Hugo Rifkind exploring the luxury of rejection, ridicule and hangovers, plus Gavanndra Hodge’s brilliant pieces on how to talk to your children about topics like fashion, money and friendship. Both are thought-provoking and often very funny.

We’ll also send you news from the Times science editor Tom Whipple, who will clue you into the coolest gadgets on the market, from foldable laptops to high-tech water guns. Plus there are extraordinary travel destinations, like this intrepid cruise through the Antarctic or the most spectacular new hotels tucked away in the mountains, curated by the Luxx travel editor Lisa Grainger, giving you a reason to dream on the gloomiest of rainy days.
