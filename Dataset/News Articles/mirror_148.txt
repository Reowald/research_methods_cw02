This weekend is set to be wet and rainy for many but clouds are slowly clearing to the south leading to some bright spells and blue skies as the week ahead could see snow

UK weather: New maps show exactly where and when 'double snow event' will hit - full list of areas

New weather maps show when and where snow could hit over two days in the coming week.

This weekend initially saw a severe weather warning covering all of England - threatening to bring as much as 40mm rain. But this was downgraded twice as rain eased until only the South East and East Anglia were set to be hit by the rain.

The Met Office warned: "Rain will continue east across east and southeast England on Sunday morning, before clearing by midday. With this rain falling on already saturated ground, impacts are more likely. Many places are likely to see 10-15 mm of rain, although 20 mm is possible in a few places, this falling in a few hours."

This comes ahead of a week that could see two bouts of snow, with both February 22 and 25 facing the possibility of flurries, WXCharts forecast. The heaviest of the snow is forecast on Thursday, up the west coast of the UK with swathes of Wales predicted to be hit.

Alongside that, the potential snow stretches up the North West, hitting Manchester towards the Peak District. Thereâ€™s also a pocket of snow forecast that could hit in the north west of Scotland. The forecaster reckons the worst of the snow will hit around midday before passing out and easing into the afternoon.

Then, three days later on the 25, more snow could make a return, this time hitting parts of central and northern England, but returning to the north western parts of Scotland.
