Rebecca Ferguson exuded glamour in a caped glitzy black gown at the Dune: Part Two premiere in Leicester Square, London on Thursday.

The Swedish actress, 40, who plays Lady Jessica Atreides in the movie, stunned in the glamorous ensemble.

The beauty showed off her hourglass figure in the bodycon ensemble as she struck a pose on the unique sandy 'red carpet' - in theme for the movie.

Fans were in awe of Rebecca's outfit as they watched on from the sidelines as she posed for the cameras.

Rebecca kept accessories to a minimum to let the high-neck gown do the talking, as she wore simplistic studded earrings.

Rebecca stars as Timothée Chalamet's (Paul Atreides) on screen mother in the highly-anticipated sci-fi fantasy sequel Dune: Part Two, which hits US/UK theatres March 1.

'She's a mom protecting and training someone, something,' Rebecca - who reportedly earned $500K for starring in the first Dune film - explained.

'I say something because she knows [she's dealing with] an entity bigger than themselves.

'When Paul starts going off, she begins losing power, and it puts her on an unpredicted journey to discover who we are in response to other people.

'That's when we find ourselves again.'

Director Denis Villeneuve went out of his way to incorporate more of Lady Jessica in the continuation because the character 'kind of disappears in the second part of the book.'

'I made sure as I was writing the screenplay to do the opposite, to make sure that she will be active, to bring her back to the front of the story,' the French-Canadian 55-year-old said.

'I'm looking forward for the world to see what Rebecca has accomplished. She's not afraid to go very far away. She's a force that I can count on.'

Zendaya, who plays the warrior Chani in the franchise, commanded attention in a piece of fashion history to the event as she donned a Thierry Mugler robot suit from his fall/winter 1995 Couture Collection.

The skintight outfit highlighted the star's jaw-dropping figure as it featured a cut out detail across the midriff and legs.

The new Dune sequel takes place immediately after the first film ended, when Paul (Timothee) and his mother joined forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the rest of the desert-dwelling Fremen to get revenge against the evil House Harkonnen, whose members have killed most of his family and friends.

The film was originally scheduled for a late October 2023 release, before being pushed back to November and finally shuffled all the way back to March of this year following the dual writers and actors strikes.

The sequel was co-produced with Legendary Entertainment in addition to Warner Bros. Film Group.
