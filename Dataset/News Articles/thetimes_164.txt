The clue

I don’t know why I didn’t cotton on to my friend’s intentions. It should have been obvious the moment he refused to take public transport that he was going to hijack my day. But I was distracted by the thought of a magnificent library. It’s in this city’s centre and is named after a local entrepreneur (mother: Elizabeth). I wanted to visit the site of said entrepreneur’s mansion; its estate is now a park three miles southwest of the library. Then we’d take the tram to the library to gawp at its vaulted ceiling.

Friend, however, insisted on driving — and now here we are, in a suburb just east of the park, roaring around in search of his son’s favourite racing car. Apparently, the first season of the TV programme in which the car starred was filmed at animation studios here. The building has since been demolished, but Friend wants me to photograph him at the site all the same. It’s marked by a plaque.
