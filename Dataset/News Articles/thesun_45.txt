THE Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Media has called for full honesty and clarity on golden handshake deals at RTE.

Niamh Smyth hit out at an exit package approved by the scandal-hit broadcaster that included a confidentiality clause and said: "We are not of the woods with these issues yet."

Details are continuing to emerge of exit payments at RTE following a weekend of mounting political pressure at the broadcaster to publicise payments of top execs who have left the organisation.

Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland, Niamh Smyth demanded full transparency from a meeting requested by Minister for Media Catherine Martin with RTÉ Director General Kevin Bakhurst and Chair of the Board Siún Ní Raghallaigh.

And she said that the minister summoning the Director General and the chair of the board this morning "signals that the crisis is worsening".

She added: "It will be just in the interest of the entity of RTE if the Director General and the new chair did come forward with the information not just to the minister but the committee in relation to the exit packages."

Former RTE Director of Strategy Rory Coveney is said to have received an exit payment of around €200,000 when he stood down from his role with the broadcaster last July.

Coveney, the brother of Enterprise Minister Simon Coveney, was the driving force behind €2.2m flop Toy Show The Musical.

It follows last week’s shock Dail revelation that ex-CFO Breda O’Keeffe was paid €450,000 to leave RTE.

Ms Smyth blasted the confidentiality clause and said full details of all exit packages is an "obvious requirement" from Bakhurst and the RTE board.

She said: "I mean, this debacle started eight months ago, and we were promised transparency."

She admitted the confidentiality clause in an exit package is "one of the deep concerns" she has after "being promised" full transparency and added: "That certainly doesn’t play or bode well with this idea that we are going to be given full transparency.

And when asked if she has confidence in Kevin Bakhurst, the Fianna Fail politician said she is "deeply concerned over these revelations the last week."

Ms Smyth added: "I think it’s deeply important that both the Chair and the DG come clean with the Minister and also come clean with the Media Committee who had spent three hours last week.

"I was hoping we would draw a line under all these issues when we find there are further revelations that are going to cost RTE significantly and financially.

"It would appear we are not out of the woods with these issues yet."

Taoiseach Micheal Martin has also called for “full transparency of salaries and packages” within RTE.

Speaking yesterday, the Fianna Fail leader said: “Where any organisation is being funded by the public via the licence fee in this case and taxpayers’ money, there should be full transparency.”

Asked if there should be a cap on exit money in the future, Martin said the payments “should correspond with norms”.

He added people “will want to see norms that are not excessive and are perceived to be reasonable”.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has called for “full clarity” from RTE on the payments and more details of how they are calculated.

The Dail’s powerful PAC are 90 per cent ­finished a report which will make a series of recommendations about governance changes at RTE.

But the committee will hold one more hearing before they publish.
