Ryanair has been working to get the controversial passenger cap lifted at Dublin

Ryanair was forced to pull a proposal to base four more Boeing aircraft at Dublin airport this year, capable of delivering two million extra travellers, as a result of the passenger cap at the airport.

Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said the airline was on course to carry an extra 17.5 million passengers this year, “but none of them through Dublin”. O’Leary is continuing to put pressure on the government to get the cap lifted through legislation, if necessary, warning of dire consequences for the tourism industry here.

The cap could condemn Dublin to zero growth for a number of years if operator DAA’s application to Fingal county council, to raise passenger numbers from 32 million annually to 40 million, ends up in court.
