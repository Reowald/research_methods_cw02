Matheus Cunha's hat-trick helped Wolves claim a 4-2 comeback victory at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea dropped into the bottom half of the Premier League table.

Cole Palmer's goal had seemed to have his side on their way to a fifth home league win in a row when he slotted in after 19 minutes.

Thereafter however, Gary O'Neil's team dictated everything, with Cunha leading the way, although Chelsea will deem themselves unfortunate to have conceded from two big deflections in the first half, one of which was given as an own goal against Axel Disasi.

Thiago Silva headed a consolation near the end before home supporters let the depth of their anger be known.

Chelsea fans sing for Mourinho

Thiago Silva’s wife, Belle, is known for being outspoken on social media and she posted towards the end of this loss: ‘It’s time to change. If you wait any longer it will be too late.’

Whether she was calling for Mauricio Pochettino to be sacked, or suggesting that her 39-year-old husband should leave the club as has been rumoured of late, only she knows.

But it is not ideal for Pochettino to have one of his player’s wives fanning the flames when he’s already feeling the heat.

There were supporters at Stamford Bridge saying they would take Jose Mourinho back in a heartbeat.

Mourinho’s name was even sung by a small group.

Security alert at Stamford Bridge

There was talk of kick-off being delayed due to a security alert at Stamford Bridge as supporters were stopped from approaching the ground.

The Metropolitan Police told Mail Sport that the Millennium Hotel had to be evacuated after a man was found unresponsive.

Sadly, he was pronounced dead. The death is not being treated as suspicious.

More fun and games

Chelsea’s players were advertising the film, Argylle, on the back of their training shirts. But Conor Gallagher and Co might want to avoid reading the reviews.

It received one star from The Daily Telegraph, who wrote that it is ‘slapstick-driven’. Not the worst way to describe Chelsea’s football this season, either.

Blues fans see the funny side

‘You’re f***ing s***,’ sang Wolves’ supporters.

Then Chelsea’s fans joined in: ‘We’re f***ing s***.’ English football humour is alive and well.

Caicedo shows his frustration

It was an inch-perfect pass that Moises Caicedo played for Cole Palmer to open the scoring but then the £115million midfielder lost possession so that Wolves could equalise.

This was an error-strewn performance from Caicedo, who smacked his seat in frustration after being substituted.
