Day 2

After breakfast, join your tour manager for a guided tour of the city of Belfast, with its turbulent past, thriving present and hopes for the future, all brought to life. Highlights will include the major landmarks such as City Hall, Queen’s and Stormont Castle, the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and a stunning sight gradually revealed from the rising approach road. During the tour, you’ll also see West Belfast’s celebrated Peace Wall, the political murals of the Shankhill and Falls roads, and the ultramodern developments of the regenerated docks area, crowned by the glittering, breathtaking Titanic Quarter. After a fascinating morning and the opportunity for lunch (payable locally), you’ll visit the Titanic Belfast, a wonderful visitor centre set on the site where RMS Titanic was constructed a century ago. Developed as much as a tribute to the days of shipbuilding in the city as well as in commemoration of the ill-fated liner that met her untimely end on her maiden voyage in 1912, the Titanic Belfast is a dramatic, innovative and exciting presentation of the real story of the famous ship. It’s housed in nine fascinating galleries in one of the most eye-catching buildings to have been built in the UK for years. Through the use of audiovisual presentation, life-size reconstructions, interactive features and even a ‘Shipyard Ride’, the ship’s conception, construction, tragic sinking and its aftermath, as well as its rediscovery in 1985, are brought vividly to life, and you’ll leave the exhibition with a real sense of the enormity as well as the human cost of one of the 20th century’s most fateful episodes. Enjoy the remainder of the day and evening at leisure, perhaps spent soaking up the atmosphere in one of the many traditional pubs in the city centre.
