NO RETURN Prince Harry updates — Duke not seeking a return to duty despite rumours as King Charles battles cancer

PRINCE Harry is not planning to return to his royal duties, a source has insisted.

The speculation came as the Times reported the Duke had said he was ready to help the royals as the King battles cancer.

Palace insiders say the 2020 Megxit deal barring Harry and Meghan from a hybrid role arrangement remains in place.

Additionally, a source for the Duke insisted he was not seeking a return.

“Do I think if he was asked by his family to help, he would? I can’t imagine he wouldn’t try," the source said.

"Do I think he’d offer on his own? No.”
