From The Times, February 19, 1924

Tottenham Hotspur beat Oxford University in a match played for the benefit of the Prince of Wales Hospital at Tottenham, on the White Hart Lane ground, by eight goals to one. The Prince of Wales was present, and as so far recovered from his recent hunting accident as to be able to shake hands with his right hand, though his right arm was still, of course, in a sling. £185 were taken at the gates and, with the sale of covered seats, the hospital will benefit to the extent of over £200.

All expenses were paid by the directors of the Tottenham Hotspur Club. The Prince went on to the ground to meet the two teams before the match.
