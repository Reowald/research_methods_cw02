Faye Carruthers , Suzanne Wrack , Sophie Downey and Tanya Oxtoby round up the FA Cup fifth-round action, including a big win for Manchester City

On today’s pod: there was no sprinkling of FA Cup magic for the lower-league teams as the WSL sides prevailed in the fifth round.

We’ll be back next week to round up what should be a mighty weekend of WSL action, including Chelsea v Manchester City, Arsenal v Manchester United, and Leicester v Bristol City.
