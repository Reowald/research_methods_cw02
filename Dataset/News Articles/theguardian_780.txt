Skincare routines have become hugely overcomplicated, so I can see why it feels terrifying to start one. Men’s skin has more sebum than women’s, which can cause spots, blackheads and a slightly waxy look, but a cleanser with salicylic acid used morning (before you shave) and evening should help keep that sebum buildup away.

Next, choose a serum that suits your skin’s needs. Although men’s skin has a better barrier function than women’s – so it loses less water from evaporation – men do sweat more, which also causes water loss from the skin. Using a hyaluronic acid-based serum (a moisture-retaining ingredient found naturally in the body) can help rehydrate the skin, and if it also contains ceramides, it can help prevent dryness and irritation caused by shaving, too.

Men with dark or acne-prone skin susceptible to scarring might want to add in a skin-brightening serum with vitamin C instead, which helps prevent dark spots. Apply a good-quality moisturiser, and finish with an SPF 30 or 50 – extra brownie points if you take a spray SPF with you to top up during the day. Finally, the facially hirsute should massage beard oil into facial hair to keep it soft and nourish the skin underneath to prevent flaking.

That wasn’t so bad, was it? Make it extra simple by writing numbers on the products so you remember the order.
