Fulham vs Aston Villa predictions Aston Villa’s title ambitions have disintegrated since the turn of the year thanks to a run of one win in four games and they head to Fulham a point outside the top four. The Cottagers are sitting comfortably in mid-table, unbeaten in three games with Marco Silva’s side having seen off Bournemouth 3-1 last time out. They’ve now won seven of their last 12 league games at Craven Cottage yet are underdogs with for this fxture.

However, before jumping on the Fulham upset train, it’s worth remembering they’ve won one of the last seven in all competitions, threw away a two-goal lead at Burnley recently and lost the shot count against Bournemouth 25-7. Seven of Fulham’s last eight league opponents have generated at least 1.6 expected goals against them and while Aston Villa may have issues elsewhere, they don’t tend to struggle to create chances. The Villans, who won the reverse fixture 3-1, have scored two or more goals in 13 of their 24 top flight games and over 1.5 Villa goals has landed in five of their last six away assignments in the league. Fulham vs Aston Villa Tip: Over 1.5 Aston Villa goals – 20/21 with BetVictor

Newcastle vs Bournemouth predictions Newcastle made it three wins from the last four games in all competitions at Nottingham Forest last time out, but it was far from a convincing 3-2 success. The Magpies are giving up too many chances right now and needed Bruno Guimaraes to dig them out of a hole at the City Ground having come from 4-2 down to rescue a point at home to Luton in their previous game. Eddie Howe’s men look vulnerable, and a meeting with his old club, Bournemouth, raises a few concerns despite the Cherries’ recent struggles.

The south coast side’s only wins in 2024 have both come in the FA Cup and they're making silly errors defensively that they weren’t making when Andoni Iraola’s men were stacking up the wins in December. But they continue to create plenty of chances and head north having scored in all but one of their 12 away games in the league. They also deservedly beat Newcastle in the reverse fixture and with the Magpies having won one of their last five at home, it may be worth taking a chance on the underdogs in the draw no bet market on . Newcastle vs Bournemouth Tip: Bournemouth draw no bet – 41/20 with BetMGM

Nottingham Forest vs West Ham predictions Neither of these sides have won a league game since the start of 2024, although Forest would argue they’ve been closer than the Hammers to collecting three points. The Tricky Trees have lost three of their last four top flight matches, but all by a single goal, while West Ham enter this game off the back of their heaviest home defeat in the Premier League. have drastically cut David Moyes’ odds to be the in the aftermath of the 6-0 defeat to Arsenal and if there isn’t some kind of reaction to that performance, the Scot could be in serious trouble.

West Ham are set up well to hurt Forest. The Hammers have a good range of set piece options and no side has conceded more goals from non-penalty set pieces than Forest (15) this season. Moyes’ men scored twice from corners when winning the reverse fixture 3-2 with Tomas Soucek netting the winner on a day when he had three shots on target. Soucek’s aerial ability makes him a big threat to a Forest team without a clean sheet in 13 league games. Nottingham Forest vs West Ham tip: Tomas Soucek over 0.5 shots on target – 13/8 with Unibet

Tottenham vs Wolves predictions Tottenham moved up to fourth place with their last-gasp win over Brighton and are odds-on favourites with to follow up against Wolves. Spurs’ injury and international duty issues have cleared up and with Son Heung-min back in the line-up, Ange Postecoglou has his strongest attack available. Not that the north Londoners have been struggling for goals without him, failing to score just once all season, while only the league’s top three have netted more than Tottenham’s tally of 51 goals. But their attacking mindset can leave Spurs exposed at times and Wolves have shown they are good enough to take advantage of a side’s flaws.

Gary O’Neil won’t have in-form striker Matheus Cunha for this game but top scorer Hwang Hee-chan should be available, while this could be an audition for Pedro Neto should rumours of Tottenham’s transfer interest prove correct. Wolves have already beaten Tottenham once this season, but that was at Molineux and away from home they aren’t quite the same side. Still, Wolves should have enough bite about them to net in a Tottenham win with all but one of Spurs’ last 15 games having ended with both sides scoring. Tottenham vs Wolves Tip: Tottenham to win & both teams to score – 17/10 with William Hill
