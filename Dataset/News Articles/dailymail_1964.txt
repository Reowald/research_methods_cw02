Apple iPhone 11

There are certain products – the potato peeler, for instance – that even the most design-conscious person couldn’t possibly care which particular model they have.

Smartphones are rapidly heading into potato-peeler territory. It’s becoming very, very difficult to care which one you have – so I always feel faintly sorry for Apple, with its commitment to epic annual launch events where CEO Tim Cook reveals a roster of identical phones as if he’s unveiling the Ten Commandments.

It lacks bells and whistles, such as the zoom lens and sharper OLED screen of the Pro models, but the iPhone 11 a competent little phone. Just don’t expect it to revolutionise your life

But I tried the modest iPhone 11 (rather than the £1,049+ Pro handsets), and I was pleasantly surprised.

If you’ve been hanging on to an ancient, half-dead handset with the obligatory smashed screen, waiting for the ‘right’ iPhone to upgrade to, this £729 handset is a decent choice.

The key change is that Apple no longer lags behind Google and Samsung on the camera front (although iPhone 11 misses some of the gizmos you find in top-end Samsungs such as the ability to charge other phones wirelessly from your own, a power my wife abuses constantly).

Night mode is the star performer here, meaning you can finally take shots after 7pm. It turns on automatically, sprucing up pictures so you can no longer escape the all-seeing eye of social media, even at night. It lacks bells and whistles, such as the zoom lens and sharper OLED screen of the Pro models, but it’s a competent little phone. Just don’t expect it to revolutionise your life.
