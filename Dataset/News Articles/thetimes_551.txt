Late January’s Design Week is the French capital’s showcase of design and decor. That means wallcoverings, papers, paints, fine fabrics for upholstery and curtains, carpets, objects and accessories as well as collectable furniture. Here is an edit of my most memorable stops.

Hermès

MAXIME VERRET

Hermès chose the Collège des Bernardins, built from 1248 and refurbished by Jean-Michel Wilmotte, to present its tableware collection, Tressages Equestres. Inspired by the passementerie and braiding used on equestrian harnesses, the 27 pieces are all decorated by Virginie Jamin (who has created many a scarf for the house’s famous silks). The decor of each individual piece, masterminded by Benoit Pierre Emery, the creative director of La Table Hermès, is different, but they all fit together perfectly when combined. hermes.com

Rubelli

RUBELLI SPA

The historic Venetian textile company Rubelli, founded in 1889, presented its very first collection under the creative direction of Simone Farresin and Andrea Trimarchi of Milan and the Rotterdam-based studio Formafantasma. The Garden collection, richly textured in shades of melon, pistachio, lemon and orchid, was presented in a series of portraits of chairs. rubelli.com
