With barely two-thirds of the average entry reaching me, I concluded that the postal strikes had badly affected the competition and therefore it was only fair not to award prizes in the normal way. Apologies to all concerned, and I hope, maybe forlornly, that the Christmas competition will not be similarly spoilt. Meanwhile, there are enough good clues above to savour for a word that perhaps failed to yield quite the variety of inventiveness one might have hoped for. Your favourite clue was, perhaps unsurprisingly, ‘Azedders battling for preferment? It’s an old conspiracy’ for COMPLOT, from 16 mentioned at least once.

Brian Head, who deals with subscriptions to the Azed Slip, has apologized for the fact that a technical hitch caused the wrong text to appear in last month’s slip. The correct version will be sent to subscribers along with this one. (The annual subscription, Brian reminds me, is now £20, not £16.)

My warmest thanks to all of you who sent Christmas cards and seasonal good wishes to me and my family. Let us hope that the coming year brings happier times in a world beset by so much suffering.
