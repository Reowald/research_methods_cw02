Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim the British-registered Rubymar cargo ship they struck in the Gulf of Aden is at risk of sinking.

The Belize-flagged, UK-registered and Lebanese-operated ship came under attack in the Bab al-Mandab strait off Yemen on Sunday as it was heading to Bulgaria, British maritime security firm Ambrey said. The crew are said to have abandoned ship after an explosion and were rescued by another merchant vessel.
