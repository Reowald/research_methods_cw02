Barlaston Hall was bought by the pottery company Wedgwood in 1937

First-time guests are in for a surprise when they come to visit Barlaston Hall in Staffordshire. Not by the architecture — the classical grandeur has been painstakingly restored to its 18th-century original beauty — but by the eclectic interiors.

Horses and swans are everywhere: animals are a theme. The four-way conversation chair in the entrance hall is upholstered in a jazzy leopard print. The piano is shocking pink and, in the maximalist dining room, the walls and ceiling feature filigree plasterwork to rival a scene from Bridgerton. At its crest is a magnificent Thomas Pickering oil painting of the Sir Thomas Mills family, who built the house in the 1700s as a weekend shooting estate.
