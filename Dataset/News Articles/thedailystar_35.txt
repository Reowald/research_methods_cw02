The TikTok event is part of the collaboration with Love Island which started in 2020. Last week, Wes Nelson returned to the villa, but this time as a music artist, debuting his latest single 'Abracadabra'. The song, a team-up with UK Garage legend Craig David, was launched through SoundOn, TikTok's comprehensive platform for music marketing and distribution.

Wes and Craig were special guests at the annual pool party for contestants, where they rocked their DJ performance, bringing fun and magic to the show.

'Abracadabra' is now available on SoundOn and is rapidly gaining popularity on TikTok, with already 25.2k video creations. The song has hit #1 on the Capital Charts and earned Wes his first ever Top 40 hit on the UK Official Charts, racking up 52 million video views.

Indiyah's return to the villa comes after the islanders are surprised with another pool party as Ella Henderson joins the show to mark their success in the show.

As their final day in the villa comes to a close the islanders will all be sent to their hotel before coming back into the villa to find out who the public has voted as their winners.

Love Island: All Stars will crown its first winner and the pair will be given a prize fund of Â£50k to split before trying to navigate their romance on the outside.
