The world’s finest athletes are ramping up their regimes as they prepare for the 2024 Summer Olympics this July in Paris – but they’re not the only ones beefing up for the games.

Paris hotels are also ensuring they’re match-fit for the 19-day competition (running from July 26 – August 11) by hiking their prices to eye-watering levels.

The City of Light’s hotels are, on average, tripling their prices for the opening night of the Games, according to a consumer organisation study.

UFC-Que Choisir’s late-December poll of 80 three and four-star hotels showed that on the night of the opening ceremony on July 26 a double room will cost £889 ($1,130 USD/€1,033) on average, compared to £273 ($346 USD/€317) just two weeks earlier, for the night of July 12.

Despite sky-rocketing prices, hotels are seeing strong demand for the Games period - half of the hotels surveyed by the UFC report being fully booked. Thirty per cent of them had instated a minimum two-night requirement for bookings, with some insisting on as long as a five-night stay to secure a reservation.

The average required minimum stay was 3.4 days, with a nightly tariff over that period currently averaging £746 ($950 USD/€867) per night, UFC added.

These surcharges mean a four-day mini break to the French capital will set visitors back on average £2,235 ($2,850 USD/€2,594) for accommodation alone during the sporting festival.

'Olympic room rates! Paris hotels are not holding back. Their room rates are on fire,' UFC said.

The consumer organisation singled out the Villa Marquis Meliá collection hotel (five stars) as being especially representative of the dramatic surge in pricing.

The hotel has a minimum four-night stay at a cost of £1,803 ($2,292 USD/€2,092) per night, for a whopping total bill of £7,212 ($9,168 USD/€8,371) for the whole stay.

The opening ceremony will take place on the banks of the Seine - the first held outside a stadium

The Paris tourist office projects some 16million people will visit the wider Paris region for the Olympics and Paralympics, in addition to the 10,500 athletes descending on the capital to compete.

Office de Tourisme de Paris reports that the influx of spectators is expected to put pressure on every level of the housing and hotel market.

Airbnb has called on Parisians to put up their homes for rent during the Games to help keep prices down.

North of Paris, in the Seine-Saint-Denis area where the Olympic Village is under construction, thousands of migrants, asylum seekers and Roma squatting in empty buildings have been evicted, aggravating the city's homelessness problem.
