POLICE shared details of the Nottingham stabbing victims’ injuries in a WhatsApp group, a misconduct hearing was told.

An unnamed officer first posted details about students Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber plus school caretaker Ian Coates — all killed by knife maniac Valdo Calocane last June.

A second cop, PC Matthew Gell, passed on the “distasteful” message to his wife and a pal.

Barnaby’s mum Emma Webber said last night: “What an abhorrent way to conduct an investigation.

"To learn there has been internal needless voyeurism on our loved ones is unforgivable.”

Following the hearing last month, PC Gell reportedly got a final written warning and the first cop “extra learning”.

Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak has told the bereaved families he has not ruled out a public inquiry into the horror.

Cops missed several chances to stop killer Calocane's rampage.

In January, the killer pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility for killing the two students and grandfather Ian.

He will be indefinitely detained in Ashworth Hospital - where cop killer Dale Cregan said in 2016 he had a "cushy" life.

It has now been revealed the IOPC had no idea about four previous occasions Nottinghamshire Police had contact with the killer over his violence.

It is believed the force did not report details of these to the Government body.

Officials are now examining if the contact was missed opportunities to stop the triple killer.

It was then revealed that Leicestershire Police had now referred itself to the IOPC.
