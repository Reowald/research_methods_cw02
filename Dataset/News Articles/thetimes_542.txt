In the pecking order of mythological beasts, the dragon is high up there. It’s fantasy royalty, the most fantastic of all fantastic creatures. It is also the most celebrated and emblematic of Chinese zodiac symbols, not so much a myth as a strong cultural and spiritual reference. Unique in the Chinese zodiac as a creature that doesn’t exist in the physical world, the dragon (specifically, the wood dragon) is taking charge at Chinese new year, February 10, after a 12-year cycle.

People born in the year of the dragon are often believed to be naturally lucky, charismatic, enterprising, confident and powerful. Their numbers include Emma Stone, Bruce Lee, Rihanna, Boris Johnson, Adele and Andy Warhol.

In an act of homage to dragon time, watchmakers have made intriguing use of their sinuous forms on watch dials to celebrate the turn of the lunar year in a range of show-off creations, all limited editions. But these dragons may not be the ones with which we are familiar. Western mythology favours the winged fire-breathers encountered by St George; it’s the wingless, four-legged, serpentine-bodied, wily-witted creatures of eastern cultures that front the lunar new year. The dragon motif takes many shapes, the most popular looking like amalgams of several animals, a folklore Frankenstein mash-up with its snake-like body, the mane of a lion, eagle claws and horns of a deer, whiskers of a catfish, often with carp scales, sometimes featuring the eyes of a demon.
