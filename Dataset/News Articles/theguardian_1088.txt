Asir Sandler, in the entrance to his old cell in Magadan prison, holding his original arrest papers. He remembers what he weighed: 70kg when he was arrested, 42kg three months later. Sandler was arrested at the age of 30, transported and sentenced to death for treason in 1941 for carrying a book of forbidden poems. After 11 years he was freed and returned to Magadan. By 1991 he was 80 years old and had learned to become a doctor inside the camps. ‘It was the best university in the world,’ he exclaimed. ‘Every intellectual was sent there!’
