Robert Hayward as Alfio and Helen Evora as Lola in Opera North’s Cavalleria rusticana

★★★★☆

Opera North likes staging unlikely double bills. This is another. Mascagni’s 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria rusticana is probably the world’s favourite one-act opera, whereas Aleko — first performed three years later and composed by the 19-year-old Rachmaninov — is a rarity, despite offering an hour of lush, tuneful and potent music.

They fit well together if you want a double dose of adultery, heartbreak and murder. And this ingenious staging by the Polish director Karolina Sofulak makes even more explicit links. The superb baritone Robert Hayward adds to his extensive repertoire of psychopaths, thugs and broken losers not only the betrayed and vengeful Alfio in the Mascagni but also the betrayed and vengeful Aleko in the Rachmaninov.
