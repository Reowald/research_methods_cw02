This season the Royal Ballet has packed all its new work into a single Festival of New Choreography taking place this month. So while audiences in the Linbury downstairs get up close and personal with the dancers in Robert Binet’s beguiling promenade event Dark With Excessive Bright, upstairs a quartet of choreographers are making their debuts on the Royal Opera House main stage.

Four world premieres in one night — that’s New Works, a programme alive with incredible variety and creative vigour, performed by dancers at the top of their game. It begins with Boundless, Gemma Bond’s playground (her word, not mine) for 12 dancers set to Joey Roukens’s vivacious score for two pianos (Kate Shipway and Robert Clark) and orchestra.
