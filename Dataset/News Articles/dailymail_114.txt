Former UFC fighter Michael Bisping has been caught in a homophobia controversy after a hot-mic moment at UFC 298.

While working as an analyst for ESPN, Bisping was discussing the night's events when he said 'what a guy' in reference to a fighter.

The 44-year-old concluded his segment but the camera did not cut away immediately, and Bisping was then seen criticizing his own comments moments before as 'f*****g gay.'

'What a guy?' That's 'f*****g gay. Come on.'

Bisping tweeted several times on Sunday but did not address his words.

The former fighter has a history of homophobic comments, as he called opponent Luke Rockhold a 'f****t' after a win in 2016.

Bisping then said, 'S**t, I shouldn't have said that' before telling the media to 'delete that comment.'



As noted by the Guardian, Bisping was also caught calling Jorge Rivera a 'f****t motherf****r in a promotional video for UFC 127.
