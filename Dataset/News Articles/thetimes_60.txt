My mother-in-law, Eleanor Fazan, died a month ago and I’ve been writing her obituary. She worked for 68 — yes, 68 — years in theatre, and brought her son up alone. I have been contacting friends, relations and colleagues and going through memoirs and letters and am left with a sense of both admiration at her achievements and shame that I didn’t find out more about them when she was alive.

Of course I knew in a broad sense what she had done; but the anecdotes and details have brought the drama — and humour — of her career to life for me.

When she was alive, I saw her mostly as a mother, mother-in-law and grandmother. Now she’s gone I’ve come to appreciate her
