I’ve been to a handful of three-Michelin-starred restaurants over the years. Gordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White, a few in France, a couple in Italy. They were lovely. Bit stiff, but someone else was usually paying, which helps. After the Michelin guide awarded its latest round of stars last week, the Times food editor, Tony Turnbull, argued that three-star fine dining had become irrelevant. It was perceived by the public as joyless, he said, not to mention wildly expensive. Ramsay’s flagship restaurant in London has held three Michelin stars for more than 20 years. Its menu prestige now costs £210, £30 more if you want cheese, and the “bespoke” carte blanche is £260. Ramsay recently published a book, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay: A Story of Excellence
