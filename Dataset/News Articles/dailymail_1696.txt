Llorente has endured a torrid couple of months at Athletic as he continues to train with the team despite making it clear he wants to move on.

He has 10 months remaining on contract and they are refusing to budge from their buy-out clause valuation of Â£30million.

Llorente is an amiable character and is facing a tough time off the pitch with fans and the general public if he fails to secure a move before Friday night.

He would love to come to England and the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool would surely benefit from his presence.

He is aware Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks Spanish, likes the idea of playing before an appreciative crowd and would consider a move even though they are not in the Champions League.

The problem is until Andy Carroll is sold, Liverpool do not have enough money to bid. City like him a lot also but Llorente believes he will be forced to stay in Spain until January.
