Gallagher's two goals meant the midfielder has three in two games for the club, after previously enduring a 34-game goal drought.

Enzo Fernandez sealed the victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time, with the result easing pressure on manager Mauricio Pochettino as Chelsea climbed back into the top half.

Pochettino had hailed Gallagher as 'priceless' post-match.

'He's a player with great commitment with the team,' Pochettino said.

'Always trying to compensate every situation in an offensive and defensive situation and that is priceless to have a player like him.

'I'm so happy for him and I'm so happy for the team because it's a victory we needed, the three points to confirm the reaction after Wolverhampton.

'It was a very good game against Aston Villa and it was a great opportunity.'
