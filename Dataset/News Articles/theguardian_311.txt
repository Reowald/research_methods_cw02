Castlerigg Stone Circle and St. John’s in the Vale, 21.6km /13.4 miles, 5-6 hours



A lovely ‘figure of 8’ shaped walk which although ascends to the popular Castlerigg Stone Circle, soon takes minor trails to the unfrequented St.John’s in the Vale, a very pretty valley with a small church. Following the valleyside above St. John’s Beck, a beautiful lane is followed through woods and pastures passing Low Bridge Farm where quite often teas are available. Then it's up to cross the A591 road where if you want to shorten the walk you can take the bus back to Keswick. Crossing the road you then take a minor road around the head of Thirlmere before taking tracks via Shoulthwaite and Shaw Bank to retrace an earlier section of path in reverse before diverting across fields and into the trees of ‘Springs Wood’ before returning to Keswick. If you wanted a longer walk, a short bus ride takes you into Borrowdale, then you follow a low to medium level linear walk along the Cumbria Way. You will have the chance to dawdle along and hopefully enjoy the scenery. From Rosthwaite you join the beautiful River Derwent which we more or less follow on its course to the beautiful island studded lake of Derwent Water. The Cumbria Way clings to the valley bottom and Derwentwater lakeshore. It may be possible to stop for a coffee break or early lunch at a cafe in Grange-in-Borrowdale. There are some attractive places to picnic along the shore of Derwentwater. You can extend the walk by making a diversion from Hawse End to climb the very beautiful little peak with the delightful name of Catbells.
