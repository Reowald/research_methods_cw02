2 Daniel Wiffen now hopes he can be the man to break the world record

22-year-old Wiffen claimed his place in history by winning Ireland's first ever medal at the games on Thursday after he stormed to an emphatic victory in the 800m freestyle event.

He followed that up by clocking a national record of time of 14:34.07 in the 1500, and now he wants to go a step further and break the world record.

The County Down star finished just two and a half seconds outside the championship record, and six off the world-record.

He finished ahead of Florian Wellbrock after the German clocked a time of 14:44.61.

David Aubry of France completed the podium places after a swim of 14:44.85.

Speaking to media after his second gold in Qatar, the confident Wiffen said he hopes to be the man to break the world record.

Chinese swimmer Sun Yang holds the current 1500m target that was set at the 2012 Olympics.

He beamed: "I'm so happy to come out with personal best and two gold medals.

"Yeah, 100%. It is definitely one of my goals to try and beat that [world record] at some point.

"I mean...I'm 22 years-old, so I've another couple of Olympics in me.

"I'm sure it will go at some stage, and I hope to be the person to do it."

It's been an incredible start to the year for the Irish ace as he now targets a medal haul at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

Last year he became the 2023 European short-course (25-metre pool) champion over 400, 800 and 1500 metres freestyle, and the first Irish swimmer to win European short-course gold.
