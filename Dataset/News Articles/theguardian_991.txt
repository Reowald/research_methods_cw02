Stone, Staffordshire

Inspired by Usonian architecture (buildings and landscapes in the US), this single-storey house is low slung with flat roofs. The fashion for inside-outside rooms, which open up entirely on to the garden, is not a new fad and was a feature of the 50s (when this four-bedroom house was built). Here, the sliding doors off the wide living room lead out to a patio with an oversized concrete table and chairs. Inside is a showcase of exposed brickwork, overhead timber panelling and tiled corridors, in a palette of brown, cream and orange. Â£1m. The Modern House , 020 3795 5920
