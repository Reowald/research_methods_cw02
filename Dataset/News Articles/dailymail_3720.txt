The annual love holiday Valentine's Day - when women receive boxes of chocolates, diamond jewelry and red roses - fell on Wednesday this year.

And Hollywood stars were quick to take to social media to spread loving notes to their loyal followers first thing in the morning.

Many of these lovely ladies took off their clothes to flash their lingerie or bikinis, which seems to have become a Valentine's Day tradition in recent years.

Others just left cute red heart emojis as they posed with their family, pets and friends.

And some - like Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian - showed off their pink and red themed baked goods.

Comedienne Kathy Griffin did not seem as excited about the holiday, however, as she tweeted: 'I’m getting divorced. F*** Valentine’s Day and f*** all of you. Did I say that? Thank God I have three shows this weekend. I’m going to make every member of the audience my personal Valentine regardless of sexual orientation.'

She said it is all about replacing ingredients.

'I often make chocolate chip cookies at home, it is my favorite ever since I was a child. I used to add in all the ingredients on the package.

'Now I use other ingredients.'

Blanca said that instead of using sugar, she uses zero calorie sugar like Stevia.

'There are many options these days and it feels a bit like cheating but there are some really healthy options like Stevia and they taste great.

'I also use gluten free flour, low salt, very pure, organic vanilla extract, Keto Chocolate Chips and unsweetened apple sauce.'

Another hack? 'I love backed apples and I used to use real sugar, but now I use Stevia and cinnamon. It is a great treat and not very fattening at all.'

It really does help and if you do it every day you can lose a pound a week.'

She said she is just like everyone else when it comes to workout burnout.

'A lot of people think I love to go to the gym, and the truth is I sometimes really don't, as in sometimes I would love to stay home and binge watch Netflix,' she told DailyMail.com.

'I usually work out for one hour a day, five days a week. I do it for my mental health, because it makes me feel so positive. Even those two 10 minute workouts rev me up and shoots up my endorphins.'

Later during the episode, Barrymore had Lutes ask his love some questions, including what 'something really weird that' they do when 'no one else is around.'

'There’s so many things that come to mind,' she gushed. 'The best part of being with Jordan is that we are able to be our goofiest selves together.'

Lovato gushed that her 'favorite thing' is when they do random silly dances while brushing their teeth.

As for their dream date, she said 'anywhere' with Lutes 'is great.'

Pivoting from questions about their relationship, the performer then inquired if she would 'rather eat pickles, drink pickle juice or freeze the pickles into popsicles.'

'You know I am a big fan of the pickle juice popsicles, I may have to go with those,' she mused.

'9 Valentines in…and sometimes it may look like this..Baby Crash:) Nothing compares to this Love. Truly grateful for our Love! You and our precious babies. I love you so much @DangeRussWilson. Happy Valentines Day,' she captioned the post.
