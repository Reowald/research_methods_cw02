Samsung devices look set to get a massive Android boost later this year - here's what's been announced so far and what Galaxy devices will be compatible.

Huge free Samsung Galaxy upgrade confirmed but only if your phone is on this list

Millions of smartphones will be treated to a blockbuster free upgrade later this year with Google just confirming the existence of Android 15. This latest and greatest operating system, which will replace Android 14 in the latter part of 2024, is now available as a developer preview with app creators and software designers getting a sneak peek at what's to come.

Although full details won't be unleashed until Google's I/O conference in May, we do already know that Android 15 will offer improved efficiency when using apps, better security against dangerous malware and improved camera features for third-party apps.

That image boost could mean services such as Snapchat and Instagram get instant access to some of the best functionality embedded within the Android operating system such as low-light previews and access to the flash controls to adjust the intensity.

Once a full feature list has been exposed, Android 15 will then be fully released to developers for beta testing. Once that's complete the US technology giant usually lets its Pixel owners download things first. This will then be followed by Samsung's version of Android 15, called One UI 7, arriving in the last part of the year.

Although nothing has yet been officially confirmed, the team at SamMobile have composed a full list of Galaxy devices they expect to be compatible with Android 15 and all of its shiny new features. These include the new S24 range along with Galaxy S23 and a swathe of older and cheaper call makers.
