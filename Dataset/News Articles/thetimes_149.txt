Is there a greater luxury than a cancelled meeting? Especially one cancelled at short notice. The effort:reward ratio is unbeatable. All you had to do was nothing and, like a gift from above, you’re given an hour of your life back. The added sweetness of being the cancellee is that it gives you the moral high ground: “Oh gosh, don’t worry, no I totally understand. You just let me know when you’re ready to reschedule…” Most beautiful words in the English language.

Even better, this reaction doesn’t (necessarily) mean we’re terrible people. Delight is baked into our brain chemistry, simply because of the unexpected nature of the gift. A hot neuroscientific theory is something called predictive processing. In brief, our brains only process a relatively small amount of all the sensory input available to us. The only bits our minds are really interested in are those that are different from what we’re expecting. Apparently, this is a wonderfully energy-efficient way for our brains to work.
