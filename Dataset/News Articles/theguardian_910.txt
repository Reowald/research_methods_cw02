Zeinab Badawi, the author and broadcaster, will guide us through Africa’s spectacular history, as explored in her new book, An African History of Africa.

‘The history of Africa is the story of the origins of human civilisation’, states Badawi, yet little of its early and modern history is widely known. The continent has been neglected, overlooked and dominated by Western narratives of poverty, slavery and colonialism. An African History of Africa traces the sprawling history of the continent through the voices of Africans themselves – of countless historians, anthropologists, archaeologists and local storytellers from across more than 30 countries.



In this livestreamed and interactive event, Badawi will reveal the engrossing tales of warrior queens, mighty civilisations, lavish buildings, and bustling markets that show how Africa’s history is so much more than the story we think we know.



Born in Sudan, Badawi is an award-winning broadcaster, journalist and the president of SOAS, University of London. Join her, with the Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik, as they discuss the book and its present-day significance. From the origins of ancient civilisations and medieval empires, to the miseries of conquest and the elation of independence, you will come away with a deeper understanding of the epic and sweeping history of the planet’s oldest inhabited continent.
