Mountains, woodland, meadows

I was surprised how green "Green Spain" is. On landing I thought it looked more like Austria, and this resemblance persisted. It had been rainy before we went and the woodland paths were quite muddy. There are brown cows with cow bells (very docile) and a lot of goats (very friendly). Our week was hot and humid so on the last day we set off at 8am instead of the normal 9am. The area is very peaceful, but there are few way-marked trails so it was useful to have a guide. On the free day we chose to go to the coast. The beach at Poo (yes it is called Poo) is stunning - lovely soft golden sand and restaurants overlooking the beach. We were less impressed with Llanes - it is OK and the icecreams from the van the group are picked up at are superb (and huge! - save room for one) but given how nice the beach at Poo is we would probably spend more time there if it is a nice day. The hotel has a nice garden to sit out in with stunning views of the mountains (sometimes hidden in mist, sometimes clear against blue sky). The hotel staff are very organised. The bar is a nice place to hang out after walks or before dinner. The food is very tasty. There is a small appetiser, a soup, a main and a pudding. Our only thought to improve this would be more vegetables with some of the main courses (e.g. the pork is the best ever - it is so tender - but it was served up with just one carrot along with Dauphinoise potatoes). Cutting out the appetisers would save a lot of work serving and washing up for what is a small thing. The beef curry bomb was very popular with the group - highly recommended! The prawn curry was a bit too fancy with a couple of whole prawns and my husband would have preferred a proper big bowl of prawn curry and rice rather than have to mess about dissecting his dinner. The hake with little clams on the last day was excellent. Every meal was very tasty and well cooked.
