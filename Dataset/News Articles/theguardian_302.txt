Thank you to Taylor Swift‚Äôs team for randomly emailing us a bunch of new photos right in the middle of the concert ‚Äì that was very exciting!! As a reader, Amy, just put it: ‚ÄúI have such a weird combo of emotion and FOMO with each new update. I am FOMOTIONAL.‚Äù We also are FOMOTIONAL. And if you are coming to this blog way past its end, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì you can read it all again. <3 View image in fullscreen Huge. Photograph: TAS Rights Management

3d ago 11.38 GMT Steph Harmon We‚Äôre getting some lovely emails from people as we wrap up. Nicole says ‚Äúmy daughter is at the concert and I‚Äôm sitting here in Kyneton hoping she‚Äôs enjoying her long awaited Tay Tay experience. She‚Äôs there with people she doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äì my husband‚Äôs work colleague offered her a ticket after spending two days online and missing out like so many. ‚ÄúShe knows how lucky she is to be there. I‚Äôm sorry to all of those that missed out.‚Äù Another reader, Christina, says: ‚ÄúThanks to my 13 yo I‚Äôve become a huge Swiftie. We warned her we wouldn‚Äôt try to get tickets due to the cost of travelling etc, but took her to opening night of the movie. We were all transfixed and singing along in that cinema full of young fans. I hadn‚Äôt felt so much joy in a room. Can only imagine how magic it has and will be for those going to the concert.‚Äù She says her daughter has been updating us ‚Äúall evening thanks to your blog ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a pretty special kind of infectious joy and magic that she spreads.‚Äù We could not agree more. Taylor is currently singing Midnight Rains. Four songs left. Argh. Here‚Äôs a pic from up the back. View image in fullscreen Photograph: Meadow Nguyen

3d ago 11.32 GMT Cait Kelly As the show reaches its final act, we‚Äôre thinking about Adelaide-based Shelley Roach and her daughter Morgen, 14, who missed out on tickets. Shelley decided to drive them the 730km to Melbourne so they could sit outside and listen to the concert. When we met, the pair were sitting in the park around the MCG with their family friend Tanya. The decorated their chairs in Taylor theme. Morgan said they tried so hard to get tickets ‚Äì her mum almost ate fish eyes in a competition: We couldn‚Äôt get tickets. We trained so many times. Mum nearly won a competition on the radio but someone got put in before mum, which was really sad. She was going to eat fish eyes! We didn‚Äôt get any of them, or any re-sales, so mum said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs drive out to Melbourne‚Äô. We stayed with mum‚Äôs best friend she hadn‚Äôt seen in a long time. Now we are here ‚Äì we are going to enjoy the atmosphere. View image in fullscreen Tanya, Morgen and Shelley outside the MCG. Photograph: Cait Kelly They left Adelaide on Thursday morning at 6.40am, and because of the traffic drove for 12 hours to Melbourne, listening to Taylor the whole way. Morgan said Marjorie was her favourite song. It makes me cry every time I hear it. It makes me think about my grandma, she wrote it about her grandma. I will cry a bunch. People might think I‚Äôm a brat sitting outside crying, that I‚Äôm not inside, but it‚Äôs just the song! The song is so sad! She said she lives ‚Äúeverything about‚Äù Taylor. She [has] created such a community. Being here, they‚Äôre so kind and everyone is making bracelets. There‚Äôs so many people here, and she did that. Nobody else did that. I love that she is who she is and she is OK to say what she thinks. She‚Äôs great. View image in fullscreen Taylor Swift bedazzled chair.

3d ago 11.30 GMT Our last era! The final era of the night is saved for the album, Midnights, which could‚Äôve been the entire tour if it weren‚Äôt for the pandemic (I mean I am really glad we just got 3.5 hours instead). Midnights is Swift‚Äôs tenth and latest studio album (aside from her re-records) and the era she is living in today. It‚Äôs sleepless nights, lavender haze, smeared lipstick, splashed wine, and of course, friendship bracelets. For the closing chapter of the concert, Swift opens with Lavender Haze, then the lead single Anti-Hero, followed by Midnight Rain, Vigilante Shit, Bejeweled, Mastermind and Karma. Let‚Äôs go!



3d ago 11.29 GMT Woah OK. Taylor has also unveiled ‚Äúan alternative cover to Tortured Poets no one has seen. There is an exclusive song on this called the Bolter. This is called the Bolter edition.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what it looks like ‚Äì thank you to our woman in the room who took this photo while also transcribing all the quotes, Sian Cain!

3d ago 11.28 GMT The best transition there ever was After Swift performs the surprise songs, a hole on the T-shaped stage opens, and Taylor dives into it and ‚Äúswims‚Äù towards the main stage. There are visual and sound effects simulating a swimming pool: Allow TikTok content? This article includes content provided by TikTok.
