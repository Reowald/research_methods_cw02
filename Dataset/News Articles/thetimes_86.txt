David Martell, the boss of Evios, expects to start selling his Andersen electric vehicle chargers overseas soon

Founder of electric vehicle charger company says the sector needs stability

A serial entrepreneur who is building his second electric vehicle charging company says the government’s wavering commitment to its net zero pledges is one of the biggest blockers to an acceleration in electric car sales.

David Martell, the founder and chief executive of Evios, which sells high-end Andersen electric vehicle chargers, said: “Like most businesses, the one thing we need is stability. We don’t like U-turns and changes in regulations.”

Last September, Rishi Sunak rowed back on some key net zero pledges, including pushing back a ban on new petrol-only cars from 2030 to 2035. Data published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders last month showed that the number of new electric car registrations in December was down a third from December 2022.
