Britain, as everyone knows, is jam-packed with opportunities for adventure and making unique discoveries.

But a fascinating new map – the Great British Bucket List Map (marvellousmaps.com) – reveals that the UK is blessed with more things to do, see and eat than you could ever imagine.

The publisher says: 'The stunning scenery, cultural intrigue and truly ridiculous place names ensure you'll never be a tourist bored [in Britain]. But where in Britain should be on your bucket list? This gold-standard selection of places to go and things to know is a treasury of crowdsourced local intel, road-less-travelled experiences and (mostly) free fun.
