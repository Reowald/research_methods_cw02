David Haig: “Writing is good for age. I’m 68 now so I like that privacy, that quietness”

‘You’ve got me at the right moment,” says David Haig, the actor who for decades cornered the market in playing affable but uptight Brits with frayed comic brio. And there we were thinking he was easing into retirement, aged 68. He smiles at the thought. He hasn’t been on TV much — a recurring role in Sky’s thriller series COBRA aside — and hasn’t appeared on stage since 2017. Yet, with a growing career as a playwright, he’s never had more going on. Some of it not remotely what you’d expect from him.

For immediate proof: we are talking in the rehearsal room for Minority Report, his adaptation of the Philip K Dick story that became a 2002 Steven Spielberg film starring Tom Cruise.
