Across all age groups, 13% of adults said they use their savings and 12% use credit cards to fund their lifestyle.

Adam Bullock, UK director at TopCashback said: “Despite the cost-of-living crisis crippling finances, we’ve found that so many people have felt the pressure to keep up with others’ lifestyles – diving into their savings and living beyond their means to match up.

“It’s particularly worrying that younger adults are the most susceptible to the ‘keeping up with the Joneses’ mentality.”

The survey also looked at the extent to which money worries are impacting adults across generally. Three in 10 (30%) people said they dwell on money worries at least once a week.

A quarter (25%) of people said they have lost sleep over money concerns more than once a week.

Censuswide surveyed more than 2,000 people across the UK in November 2023 for the report.
