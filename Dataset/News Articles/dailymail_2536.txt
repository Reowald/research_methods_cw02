When it comes to great value holidays, it's hard to beat a cruise. That's why more people than ever are catching on with a record 35.7million due to cruise this year — that's up six per cent from 31.5million in 2023, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.

January falls into the Wave Season when cruise lines push the boat out with their best offers — so whether it's a fly-cruise or a sailing from the UK on a new ship, there are plenty of tempting itineraries...
