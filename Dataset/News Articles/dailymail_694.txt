Cillian Murphy, 47, received his first ever BAFTA nomination for his portrayal of titular character Oppenheimer and will go head-to-head with fellow Irishman Barry Keoghan, 31, for Saltburn in the Best Actor category.

They will battle it out with Bradley Cooper for Maestro, Colman Domingo for Rustin, Paul Giamatti for The Holdovers and Teo Yoo for Past Lives.

Cilian's co-stars Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr are also nominated in the Supporting categories.

Oppenheimer, which was a box office juggernaut when it was released in cinemas last year on the same day as Barbie - sparking the Barbenheimer phenomenon - will compete for Best Film against Yorgos Lanthimos's gothic fairytale Poor Things, which scored 11 nods and is the second most nominated film this year.

Also in the running is French courtroom drama Anatomy Of A Fall, Martin Scorsese's western crime thriller Killers Of The Flower Moon and The Holdovers, about a cranky prep school teacher forced to remain on campus over the holidays with a troubled student.

Oppenheimer could see Nolan pick up his first ever Director BAFTA.

He faces competition from All Of Us Strangers director Andrew Haigh, Anatomy Of A Fall's Justine Triet, The Holdovers' Alexander Payne, Maestro's Cooper and Jonathan Glazer for The Zone Of Interest.

Notably absent from the category is Barbie's director Greta Gerwig, while the movie - which was the highest-grossing film of 2023 - was also snubbed for Best Film.

Barbie star Margot Robbie is up for Best Actress and will compete in a category that notably excludes Killers of the Flower Moon's Lily Gladstone, despite her awards season success so far. The Scorsese epic received nine nods in total.

The remaining Best Actress nominees are against Poor Things' Emma Stone, Maestro's Carey Mulligan, Anatomy Of A Fall's Sandra Huller, The Colour Purple's Fantasia Barrino and Rye Lane's Vivian Oparah.

German actress Huller is also nominated in a second category, and will battle it out for Supporting Actress for The Zone Of Interest, alongside Oppenheimer's Blunt, Saltburn's Rosamund Pike, The Holdovers' Da'Vine Joy Randolph, The Colour Purple's Danielle Brooks and All Of Us Strangers' Claire Foy.

Oppenheimer's Downey Jr, will be hoping to continue his winning streak after being nominated in the Supporting Actor category. He has already won a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice award for his performance as Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
