The soldiers needed a double take after coming across the man enjoying a slice he’d served himself in their canteen over the weekend.

The Irish Sun understands gardai were called to the barracks to take the toast-scoffing invader away.

A source told us last night: “Soldiers came across a man in the tea room of the transport section of the barracks. He was in there making himself tea and toast.

“He was no trouble by all reports. He wasn’t being aggressive to soldiers or staff or anything like that.

“He seemed a bit confused but didn’t cause any trouble.”

Gardai last night confirmed cops attended Cathal Brugha army barracks on Saturday.

A spokersperson told The Irish Sun: “Gardai are investigating a public order incident that occurred on the morning of Saturday 17th February 2024 at a premises in the Dublin 6 area.

“A man in his 30s was arrested and he has since been charged to appear in court at a later date.”

Built between 1810 and 1815, Cathal Brugha Barracks was originally called Portobello Barracks before being renamed after the 1916 Rising leader in 1952.

It is currently the home of 2 Brigade, the 7th Infantry Battalion and numerous combat service support units, including the Defence Forces School of Music.
