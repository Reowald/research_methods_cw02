Richard Sauerman is the oldest groom to ever appear on Married At First Sight Australia, and the motivational speaker hasn't let his age hold him back.

During Sunday night's Commitment Ceremony, Richard, 62, shocked the MAFS experts when they asked him how intimacy week went with wife Andrea.

'We did intimacy week the week before intimacy week,' he announced to chortles of laughter.

'We gazed, we hugged, we f***ed, we s***ed, we did everything,' he continued, before shamelessly adding: 'We did the whole lot'.

While everyone - including his fellow participants - were catching their breath from the frank sexual revelation, his poor wife Andrea was seen covering her face in embarrassment.

Understandably, it wasn't long before social media erupted.

'So Richard and Andrea just banged away their troubles during Intimacy Week, huh?' wrote one viewer.

'At least he didn't go into too much detail,' they added.

'Oh geez keep it to yourself Richard,' wrote another.

'Richard just gets more ick every time he opens his mouth,' commented one more, clearly unhappy with his confession.

Elsewhere, others didn't seem to mind his honesty.

'Richard and Andrea are hilarious!! Oldest couple and just getting in there and getting it done,' wrote one impressed fan.

'Onya Richard,' added another.

Understandably, it wasn't long before social media erupted.

Richard has been very vocal about the details of his raunchy sex life with TV bride Andrea.

It comes after Richard made yet another shocking revelation during last week's Commitment Ceremony.

Despite being the oldest couple on season 11, they proved they're more energetic than any of the other contestants when they took to the couch.

When the relationship experts asked about their physical intimacy, Andrea attempted to give a conservative answer.

However, Richard quickly cut in and admitted they have sex '2-4 times a day, every day' prompting the other contestants to erupt into laughter and cheers.

Married At First Sight continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine and 9Now.
