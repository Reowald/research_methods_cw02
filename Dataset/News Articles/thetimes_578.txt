Tommy Moller Nielsen loved travel and more than loved football, and if Manchester United needed to watch a player in some corner of the world, Tommy always put his hand up for the job.

From his trips, he’d send snapshots. His son, Benjamin, still has the messages on his phone from Georgia and Romania, where Tommy was United’s scout at last summer’s European Under-21 Championship. Pictures of a street market, video of a stadium, a funny photo of an overdressed hotel bell boy, who looked like an extra from a film. But on July 9, the messages stopped.

Tommy, one of United’s most senior scouts, whose core territory was Scandinavia, was supposed to fly home to Denmark, via Frankfurt from Romania, when the tournament ended.
