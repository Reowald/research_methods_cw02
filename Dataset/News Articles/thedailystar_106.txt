TV fave Amanda Holden has revealed she and co-star Alan Carr were still tanked up from the previous night as they put in hours of back-breaking labour on their BBC Italian Job house show.

The pair are back on the box for a second series of the hit house renovation show and the pals have confessed they like a drink after filming.

And there have been one or two mishaps with the crew.

Amanda told a telly mag: “It’s a lot more hard work than probably people think - because there are laughs, but it’s 12/14-hour days and we are physically knackered by the end. It’s proper hard graft with a lot of travelling.

“There’s been a few days where we’ve had a bad hangover and we’ve had to pull a ceiling down or climb a mountain, but that’s our own doing.

“No, overall, we felt quite safe. There were a couple of crew who fell through ceilings, but that’s another story!”

Alan added: “That is my bugbear, when people assume that we just arrive at eight o’clock and at 8.02, I put the drill down, then we go to the pub and have a drink!

“The episode where we did the garden, with the gravel, it was so hot. That nearly killed me. And in the end, it just looked like a cat litter tray!”

The pair added that a third series could also be in the pipeline but with another destination like Portugal a contender.
