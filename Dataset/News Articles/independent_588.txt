Watch the moment the first US moon landing mission since Apollo blasts off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Monday 8 January.

Onboard the Vulcan rocket is the Peregrine Mission One, the first US moon lander to launch into space since the final Apollo project in 1972 - more than 50 years ago.

If all goes well, it will first loop around Earth before heading to the moon and attempting a landing at Sinus Viscositatis on Friday 23 February.

The Peregrine Mission One has been named after the fastest bird in the world.
