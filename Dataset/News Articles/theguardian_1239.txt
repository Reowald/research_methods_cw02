Hanover-based photographer Valentin Goppel presents a metaphor for the period of transition between child and adulthood. Shot in the time between Christmas and new year, the images reflect a sense of suspended time or paralysis between before the Covid pandemic and an unknown future. Of this image, Goppel says: ‘I was visiting my parents when the news first spoke of a lockdown. Thrilled at the thought of what I saw as an extended vacation ... the joy did not last long.’ Zwischen den Jahren (Between the Years) is available to purchase from GOST books .
