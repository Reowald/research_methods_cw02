Teresa Giudice and her husband Louie Ruelas poured on the PDA as they soaked up the sun in Miami Beach Sunday.

The passionate pair didn't seem to care who might be watching them get quite close on a chaise lounge on the beach.

Louie, 48, who is being sued by his former fianc√©e for alleged harassment, looked relaxed in black Balmain swim trunks with a white stripe bearing the designer's name.

The entrepreneur wore black, green and red Gucci slide sandals and carried a floral shopping bag with the couple's beach gear.

He was shirtless and wore a medallion on a black rope chain, and covered his dark hair with a black billed hat.

Louie appeared as if he may have gotten too much sun as he held his wife's hand for the return to their hotel.

Teresa, 51, showed off her curves in a tiny black bikini, consisting of a triangle top and string bottom.

The Real Housewives of New Jersey star's long, dark hair was styled in loose waves.

She appeared to be wearing natural looking makeup with a berry toned lip.

The reality star protected her eyes from the bright light with a pair of large, dark sunglasses.

According to Teresa's Instagram Stories, the couple seemed to have traveled to Miami Beach from New Jersey to celebrate a friend's birthday.

The pair have been staying at the Faena hotel, and have been taking advantage of some of the amenities, including facials and IV vitamin therapy infusion drips.

Before travelling south for sun and fun, Teresa watched her daughters, Gia, 23, Milania, 18 and Audriana, 14, walk the runway at New York Fashion week for the Estrada Twins show.

As fans look forward to the debut of RHONJ season 14, and whether or not Teresa and sister-in-law Melissa Gorga, have put their differences aside.

'The biggest misconception is that it's gonna be more drama between me and my sister-in-law, Melissa told Entertainment Tonight in January. 'We don't even, like, look at each other.'

'It is the new normal,' she added. 'I think it just is what it is. I always say it's unfortunate.'

'I'll never be, like, happy about that,' she explained. 'But we're all living, and we're happy, and sometimes things just need to take its course. Right now that's definitely how it is.'
