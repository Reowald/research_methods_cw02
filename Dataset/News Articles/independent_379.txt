England fell to a dismal defeat against India as the visitors capitulated and the hosts recorded their biggest-ever Test victory. India won by 434 runs in Rajkot as England collapsed to 122 all out in the second innings.

India set England a huge target and then skittled the tourists to go 2-1 up in the five-match series. India had been in the box seat since grabbing a handy first-innings lead of 126 and they never took their foot off the pedal.

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal smashed an unbeaten 214, Shubman Gill made 91 and debutant Sarfaraz Khan struck his second fifty of the match before India declared their second innings on 430-4.

Chasing a record 557 for victory, England slumped to 50-7 with Ravindra Jadeja wrecking their middle order as Joe Root continued to struggle. Once Kuldeep Yadav dismissed England captain Ben Stokes lbw for 15, the match was effectively over.

Mark Wood made a quickfire 33 before being the last England batter dismissed. Follow all the latest live coverage of today's match in the live blog below, and get the latest odds and tips here.
