Contrary to popular opinion, we’d argue that the best person to get lingerie from is you. By giving yourself the gift of gorgeous undies you can guarantee that all the elements are just right, from the fit to the feel to the various bells and whistles. This way you can also avoid ending up tied into a not-so-sexy knot of strings and buckles.

It was actually the socialite Mary Phelps Jacobs who invented the brassiere in 1910. Jacobs was so fed up with the uncomfortable, restrictive corsets popular at the time that she tied together two handkerchiefs with a ribbon and went off to a debutante ball. The concept became so popular among Jacob’s friends that only four years later she was granted a patent for the design, leading to the bras and lingerie of today. So really, lingerie has always been made by women for women.
