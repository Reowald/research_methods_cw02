Fortnite is turning into a digital Disneyland.

The Mouse House has bought a $1.5bn stake in Epic Games, the maker of the popular free-to-play online shooter game.

And Disney is hoping to develop a new expansive, open, persistent, and social universe that will “interoperate” with Fortnite and let fans “play, watch, shop, and engage” with their favorite characters.

So you’ll be seeing Mickey and the gang join forces with the likes of Marvel and Star Wars in the popular eve-revolving console hit.

Bob Iger, Disney boss, said: “Our exciting new relationship with Epic Games will bring together Disney’s beloved brands and franchises with the hugely popular Fortnite in a transformational new games and entertainment universe.

“This marks Disney’s biggest entry ever into the world of games and offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion.

“We can’t wait for fans to experience the Disney stories and worlds they love in groundbreaking new ways.”

It comes after Fortnite bosses recently expanded the core game with a series of self-contained offshoot titles.

You can race cars with Rocket Racing thanks to a collaboration with the team that made hit video game Rocket League.

And they also joined forces with Guitar Hero makers to deliver a music themed game alongside a Lego survival world.

Tim Sweeney, CEO and Founder of Epic Games, said: “Disney was one of the first companies to believe in the potential of bringing their worlds together with ours in Fortnite, and they use Unreal Engine across their portfolio.

“Now we’re collaborating on something entirely new to build a persistent, open and interoperable ecosystem that will bring together the Disney and Fortnite communities.”

This marks Disney’s biggest entry ever into the world of games.
