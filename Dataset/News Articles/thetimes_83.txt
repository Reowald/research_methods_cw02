Cambridge Mechatronics has shipped more than 70 million products, many of which have been used in smartphone cameras for technology such as autofocus

Start-up, which makes shape-memory alloy technology used in spacecraft and robotics, closes funding round led by Atlantic Bridge

A start-up that develops shape-memory alloy technology used in sectors including spacecraft and robotics has raised $40 million.

The funding round in Cambridge Mechatronics was led by Atlantic Bridge, the growth equity firm. Intel Capital and Supernova acted as co-leads in the oversubscribed process, with further participation from the Sony Innovation Fund.

Shape-memory alloys were first properly developed in the United States in the 1960s. The unique properties of the metals, which allow them to reliably alter their shape based on their temperature, have many uses. The alloys are used to create extremely lightweight robots, to make quieter and more efficient jet engines and to move fingers in bio-engineered robotic hands.

Cambridge Mechatronics has become a pioneer in the design of actuators (a machine or
