It comes after years of rumours that the Russian president has two secret children with an Olympic gold ­medal-winning gymnast

TYRANT Vladimir Putin has grown close to a blonde Barbie lookalike who is 32 years his junior.

The 71-year-old is being linked to Ekaterina “Katya” Mizulina, 39, the head of Russia’s Safe Internet League, which clamps down on online dissent.

She graduated from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London in 2004, has a degree in art history and is the daughter of pro-Putin senator Elena Mizulina.

Ms Mizulina previously served as a translator in official Russian delegations to China.

Critics say she shares a striking resemblance to other women linked to Putin.

He was married to former flight attendant Lyudmila Putina from 1983 to 2014 and is said to have two secret children with Olympic gold ­medal-winning gymnast Alina Kabaeva, 40.

Their relationship was revealed by Alexei Navalny.

Russian human rights campaigner Olga Romanova told Ukraine’s Channel 24: “Katya Mizulina is to Putin’s taste.

“This Barbie type has always suited him very well.”
