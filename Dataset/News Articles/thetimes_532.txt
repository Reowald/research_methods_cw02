The Louis Vuitton trunk has been emblematic of luxury travel since it was first created in the 19th century. It was Vuitton himself who came up with the original design in 1837, when he was just 16 years old. The son of a farmer and a milliner, the designer had arrived in Paris from Anchay, France, a town near the Swiss border, on foot and gone directly to the atelier of Monsieur Maréchal. Maréchal was a well-known luggage craftsman, with whom Vuitton quickly commenced his apprenticeship. He spent nearly two decades learning his craft before launching his own brand in 1854. One of Vuitton’s earliest clients was the Empress of France, Eugénie de Montijo, then wife of Napoleon III. This connection helped launch Vuitton’s name among France’s aristocracy and he soon opened his first shop near Place Vendôme in Paris. By 1859 Vuitton had expanded to a larger atelier in Asnières, north of Paris, with 20 employees.

Vuitton’s launch coincided with the beginning of a boom in leisure travel — with all its attendant pleasures and perils, such as thieves and the rough handling of luggage. Vuitton designed his suitcases to be sturdy from the outset, but later he and his son, Georges, added their invention, the “unpickable lock”, to the cases. The single lock with two spring buckles was so effective that Georges even challenged Harry Houdini to attempt to escape from a locked Vuitton trunk. The escape artist declined, but the lock remains a key element in Vuitton luggage today. During the following century and a half, everyone from Greta Garbo to Keith Richards toted an LV trunk. Many of Louis Vuitton’s products are still made in the atelier at Asnières, which now has a team of more than 170.
