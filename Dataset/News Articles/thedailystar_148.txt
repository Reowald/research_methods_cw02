Julia Fox burst onto the Hollywood scene back in 2019 and instantly shot to fame - however, it wasn’t her acting skills that got me hooked.

Fox’s quippy remarks and wacky fashion sense that transpired in the interviews that followed were actually what put her on my radar. Quite frankly, Julia has quickly earned herself legendary status in my eyes.

READ MORE: Julia Fox flashes flesh in skimpy poodle outfit with pom-poms on her booty

I believe her ability to rise into a league of total pop culture icons within a matter of years is based on two things - her truly, truly bizarre outfits along with the way she absolutely refuses to be anything but unapologetically herself.

First off, Julia’s style. From a latex dominatrix suit with horse ears and a tail to a bright pink dress covered with with a giant poodle motif, from creepy clown makeup looks to a fully-fledged monster cosplay - complete with long black claws and prosthetic devil horns - Fox isn’t afraid to think outside the box. Far, far away from the box…so far, in fact, she can’t even see it through her thick, Black Swan-inspired eyeliner.

There’s just no limit to what Fox will wear: no garment too weird, no idea too obscure. She has the same daredevil attitude as early 2010s Gaga when it comes to fashion - don’t try and tell me you can’t picture Julia sporting the infamous meat dress on the red carpet (even though she’s vegan…I think she’d make it a big statement about farming animals for food or something).
