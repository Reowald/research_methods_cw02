Pity Berlin. The scrappy third member, after Venice and Cannes, of the prestigious European Film Festival triumvirate is best understood as the movie world’s version of Craig Logan from the 1980s boy band Bros — the two glamorous blonds soak up all the attention, while Berlin just stands there in the background trying to win approval from some quality guitar licks.

The grey, wintry setting doesn’t help (it used to be a summer party, but was moved in 1978 to February), nor does an awards season schedule that positions Oscar contenders for Venice and Cannes and not, alas Berlin. As a result, boast the festival organisers, they ignore Tinseltown films (although, really, who’s ignoring who?) and focus instead on politically engaged filmmaking.
